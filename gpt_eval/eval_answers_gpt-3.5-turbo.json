We carried out a survey of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among homeless men in Nagoya, Japan, and assessed the associations between diabetes prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics. Materials and methods: Interviews relating to individuals' sociodemographic background, mental illness and cognitive ability, and blood sampling were carried out for 106 homeless men (mean age 54.2 \u00b1 12.7 years). Diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia were diagnosed according to the individual's hemoglobin A1c level: \u22656.5%, 6.4-6.0% and \u22645.9%, respectively. Mental illness and cognitive disability were diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, respectively. Associations between the prevalence of diabetes/prediabetes and mental illness/cognitive disability or sociodemographic background were analyzed using the \u03c72 -test. Results: Seven (6.6%) and 12 (11.3%) participants were diagnosed as having diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, which was a similar trend to that of general populations in Japan National Health and Nutrition Survey data. There was a significant difference in the prediabetes prevalence between groups with and without a history of having social support; however, no significant associations were found between the diabetes/prediabetes prevalence and mental illness/cognitive ability or participants' sociodemographic background. Conclusions: The incidence of diabetes in Japanese homeless men was similar to that in the general population, and the prediabetes incidence was lower in the group with social support than in that without. Early intervention for preventing diabetes and social support that focuses on diabetes management is important for homeless people.",

The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method: The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant indirect effects for reading comprehension in women (7.2%; 95% CI [0.7, 19.4]) and men (7.2%; 95% CI [0.8, 19.1]), and depressive symptoms (11.8%; 95% CI [2.5, 26.6]) and perceived constraint (6.7%, 95% CI [0.7, 19.1]) in women. Conclusions: Evidence suggested that reading comprehension in women and men, and depressive symptoms and perceived constraint in women, may mediate some of the association between education and CHD risk. If these mediated effects are interpreted causally, interventions targeting reading, depressive symptoms, and perceived constraint could reduce educational inequalities in CHD.",

Studies have indicated an inverse association between education and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, suggesting that higher levels of education are associated with a lower risk of CHD [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327475/) [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00880-8) Additionally, it has been found that education and counseling can help mitigate the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554410/). Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as exercise play a determining role in reducing the risk of CHD.\n\nIn conclusion, **regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart disease**, and this is supported by evidence showing an inverse association between education and CHD risk, as well as the impact of lifestyle factors on reducing the risk of CHD."

Many negative impacts of smoking on muscles are likely reversible with smoking cessation. Objectives: To determine if the progression of skeletal muscle fat infiltration with aging is altered by smoking cessation among lung cancer screening participants. Methods: This was a secondary analysis based on the National Lung Screening Trial. Skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield unit (HU) was derived from the baseline and follow-up low-dose CT scans using a previously validated artificial intelligence algorithm. Lower attenuation indicates greater fatty infiltration. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to evaluate the associations between smoking status and the muscle attenuation trajectory. Measurements and main results: Of 19,019 included participants (age: 61 years, 5 [SD]; 11,290 males), 8,971 (47.2%) were actively smoking cigarettes. Accounting for body mass index, pack-years, percent emphysema, and other confounding factors, actively smoking predicted a lower attenuation in both males (\u03b20 =-0.88 HU, P<.001) and females (\u03b20 =-0.69 HU, P<.001), and an accelerated muscle attenuation decline-rate in males (\u03b21=-0.08 HU/y, P<.05). Age-stratified analyses indicated that the accelerated muscle attenuation decline associated with smoking likely occurred at younger age, especially in females. Conclusions: Among lung cancer screening participants, active cigarette smoking was associated with greater skeletal muscle fat infiltration in both males and females, and accelerated muscle adipose accumulation rate in males. These findings support the important role of smoking cessation in preserving muscle health.",

Objectives: To determine the association between smoking and socioeconomic (SES) on the risk of development of melanoma. Furthermore, we sought to determine the implications of smoking and SES on survival. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study. Cases were identified from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU) during 2000-2015 and controls from the general population. Smoking and SES were obtained from data linkage with other national databases. The association of smoking status and SES on the incidence of melanoma were assessed using binary logistic regression. Multivariate survival analysis was performed on a melanoma cohort using a Cox proportional hazard model using survival as the outcome. Results: During 2000-2015, 9636 patients developed melanoma. Smoking data were obtained for 7124 (73\u00b79%) of these patients. There were 26 408 controls identified from the general population. Smoking was inversely associated with melanoma incidence [odds ratio (OR) 0\u00b770, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b765-0\u00b776]. Smoking was associated with an increased overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1\u00b730, 95% CI 1\u00b709-1\u00b755], but not associated with melanoma-specific mortality. Patients with higher SES had an increased association with melanoma incidence (OR 1\u00b758, 95% CI 1\u00b744-1\u00b773). Higher SES was associated with an increased chance of both overall (HR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b781) and disease-specific survival (HR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b790). Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated that smoking appeared to be associated with reduced incidence of melanoma. Although smoking increases overall mortality, no association was observed with melanoma-specific mortality. Further work is required to determine if there is a biological mechanism underlying this relationship or an alternative explanation, such as survival bias. What's already known about this topic? Previous studies have been contradictory with both negative and positive associations between smoking and the incidence of melanoma reported. Previous studies have either been limited by publication bias because of selective reporting or underpowered. What does this study add? Our large study identified an inverse association between smoking status and melanoma incidence. Although smoking status was negatively associated with overall disease survival, no significant association was noted in melanoma-specific survival. Socioeconomic status remains closely associated with melanoma. Although higher socioeconomic populations are more likely to develop the disease, patients with lower socioeconomic status continue to have a worse prognosis.",

Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion. However, it seems that other mechanisms may explain the association between sugar consumption and development of type 2 diabetes.",

Results: Participants with type 2 diabetes had a significantly shorter digit span, b = -0.14, CIs [-0.27, -0.11] than those without type 2 diabetes. Those with type 2 diabetes did not differ from those without type 2 diabetes on fluid intelligence, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory. The associations that do exist between type 2 diabetes and cognition are consistently mediated via macrovascular problems, depressive symptoms, and to a lesser extent visceral obesity.

However, the relationship between genetic risks for obesity and working memory is not clear. In addition, whether the effect of these genetic risks on working memory in children is mediated by increased body mass index (BMI) has not been elucidated. Methods: In order to test whether the polygenic risk score (PRS) for obesity in adulthood (adulthood-BMI-PRS) is associated with working memory at 8 years of age, and whether the effect is mediated by childhood BMI, in children from the general population, participants in the Hamamatsu Birth Cohort for Mothers and Children (HBC) study in Hamamatsu, Japan, underwent testing for association of adulthood-BMI-PRS with working memory. HBC data collection began in December 2007 and is ongoing. Adulthood-BMI-PRS values were generated using summary data from the recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) undertaken in Japan, and the significance of thresholds was calculated for each outcome. Outcomes measured included the working memory index (WMI) of Weschler Intelligence Scale-4 (WISC-IV) scores and the BMI at 8 years of age. Gene-set enrichment analysis was conducted to clarify the molecular basis common to adulthood-BMI and childhood-WMI. Mediation analysis was performed to assess whether childhood-BMI of children mediated the association between adulthood-BMI-PRS and working memory. Results: A total of 734 participants (377 males, 357 females) were analyzed. Adulthood-BMI-PRS was associated with lower childhood-WMI (\u03b2[SE], -1.807 [0.668]; p = 0.010, corrected) of WISC-IV. Gene-set enrichment analyses found that regulation of neurotrophin Trk receptor signaling (\u03b2[SE], -2.020 [6.39]; p = 0.002, corrected), negative regulation of GTPase activity (\u03b2[SE], 2.001 [0.630]; p = 0.002, corrected), and regulation of gene expression epigenetic (\u03b2[SE], -2.119 [0.664]; p = 0.002, corrected) were enriched in BMI in adulthood and WMI in childhood. Mediation analysis showed that there is no mediation effect of childhood-BMI between the adulthood-BMI-PRS and working memory deficits in children. Conclusion: Adulthood-BMI-PRS was associated with working memory among children in the general population. These genetic risks were not mediated by the childhood-BMI itself and were directly associated with working memory deficits.",

The present review surveys the recent studies on the topic with both cross-sectional and longitudinal data in an attempt to establish causality. Recent findings: Most studies in the area employ cross-sectional data and conclude (without empirical justification) that obesity causes intellectual impairment. The few studies that employ prospectively longitudinal data, however, uniformly conclude that lower intelligence leads to BMI gains and obesity. A close examination of three such studies, from three different nations (Sweden, New Zealand, and the UK), leaves little doubt that the causality runs from low intelligence to obesity. Summary: The conclusion in previous studies that obesity impairs cognitive function stems from improper interpretation of a negative association between intelligence and obesity from cross-sectional studies. Results from the analyses of high-quality, population-based, prospectively longitudinal data firmly establish that low intelligence increases the chances of obesity.",

Methods: Using regression models and general structural equation models, we examined the cross-sectional association between type 2 diabetes status and: fluid intelligence; reaction time; visual memory; digit span and prospective memory; and the hypothesised mediating role of common comorbid conditions: visceral obesity; sleep problems; macrovascular problems; respiratory problems; cancer and depressive symptoms in 47,468 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, of whom 1,831 have type 2 diabetes. We controlled for ethnicity, sex, age, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels and use of diabetes medication. Results: Participants with type 2 diabetes had a significantly shorter digit span, b = -0.14, CIs [-0.27, -0.11] than those without type 2 diabetes. Those with type 2 diabetes did not differ from those without type 2 diabetes on fluid intelligence, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory. The associations that do exist between type 2 diabetes and cognition are consistently mediated via macrovascular problems, depressive symptoms, and to a lesser extent visceral obesity. Respiratory problems, sleep disturbances and cancer did not mediate the association between type 2 diabetes status and measures of cognition. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions explain some of the observed association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive deficits. This suggests that prevention, management or treatment of these comorbid conditions may be important to reduce the likelihood of cognitive decline. Treatment studies with long follow-ups are needed to examine this.",

This association is well-established in scientific research, and it is known that excess body weight, particularly visceral obesity, can increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. The relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes is complex and involves various metabolic and inflammatory processes that can contribute to the development of insulin resistance and ultimately lead to the onset of type 2 diabetes."

        "answer": "#### Can high blood pressure lead to stroke?\n\nYes, high blood pressure can lead to stroke. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a condition in which the force of blood against the walls of the arteries is too high. Over time, this can damage the blood vessels and increase the risk of various health problems, including stroke.\n\nA stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, either due to a blockage in a blood vessel (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). High blood pressure is a major risk factor for both types of stroke. It can weaken and damage the blood vessels in the brain, making them more prone to rupture or blockage [[1]](https://huggingface.co/tasks/question-answering).\n\nIt is important to manage and control high blood pressure through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication, to reduce the risk of stroke and other complications. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and working with a healthcare professional is crucial for individuals with high blood pressure.\n\nPlease"

The lack of clarity of some diet-cancer relationships reflects the ongoing debate about the relative contribution of genetic factors, environmental exposures, and replicative errors in stem cell division as determinate drivers of cancer risk. In addition, dietary guidance has often been based upon research assuming that the effects of diet and nutrition on carcinogenesis would be uniform across populations and for various tumor types arising in a specific organ, i.e., that one size fits all. Herein, we present a paradigm for investigating precision dietary patterns that leverages the approaches that led to successful small-molecule inhibitors in cancer treatment, namely understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small molecules for targeting carcinogenic mechanisms. We challenge the scientific community to refine the paradigm presented and to conduct proof-in-concept experiments that integrate existing knowledge (drug development, natural products, and the food metabolome) with developments in artificial intelligence to design and then test dietary patterns predicted to elicit drug-like effects on target tissues for cancer prevention and control. We refer to this precision approach as dietary oncopharmacognosy and envision it as the crosswalk between the currently defined fields of precision oncology and precision nutrition with the goal of reducing cancer deaths.",

Very little information is available about the particular medications that are being prescribed by community mental health services and how this has changed over time. We set out to obtain details of psychiatric medications being prescribed by one Irish community mental health service. Method: All prescribing by the Cluain Mhuire Community Mental Health Service became electronic during 2004. Using Business Intelligence software, we obtained details of all psychiatric medications prescribed from 2005 to 2016. We compared numbers of prescriptions written in the first 6 years (2005-2010) with the following 6 (2011-2016). Results: Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed medication throughout but its use declined by one-quarter over the study period. Clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol prescribing increased. Prescriptions for mood stabilisers and antidepressants fell by 25%. Sedative prescriptions declined by almost 50%. Absolute numbers of prescriptions written for methylphenidate and pregabalin were small but increased dramatically over the time period. Conclusions: This community mental health service prescribed less of most psychiatric medications in 2016, than had been the case in 2005. This is despite an increase in the numbers of patients seen over the same period. It is not clear if this pattern is echoed in other services.",

Improving communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases may help regain this lost confidence. A conference was organised at the Fondation Merieux in France to discuss what benefits could be communicated and how innovative digital initiatives can used for communication. During this meeting, a wide range of indirect benefits of vaccination were discussed. For example, influenza vaccination can reduce hospitalisations and deaths in older persons with diabetes by 45% and 38%, respectively, but the link between influenza and complications from underlying chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is frequently underestimated. Vaccination can reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is growing, by reducing the incidence of infectious disease (though direct and indirect or herd protection), by reducing the number of circulating AMR strains, and by reducing the need for antimicrobial use. Disease morbidity and treatment costs in the elderly population are likely to rise substantially, with the ageing global population. Healthy ageing and life-course vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Novel disease surveillance systems based on information from Internet search engines, mobile phone apps, social media, cloud-based electronic health records, and crowd-sourced systems, contribute to improved awareness of disease burden. Examples of the role of new techniques and tools to process data generated by multiple sources, such as artificial intelligence, to support vaccination programmes, such as influenza and dengue, were discussed. The conference participants agreed that continual efforts are needed from all stakeholders to ensure effective, transparent communication of the full benefits and risks of vaccination.",

                    "title": "The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism",
                    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.",

To address the significant gap in evaluating pulmonary nodules, we conducted a prospective study to develop a prediction model for individuals at intermediate to high risk of developing lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were applied to the training cohort (n = 560) to develop an early lung cancer prediction model. The results indicated that a model integrating clinical characteristics (age and smoking history), radiological characteristics of pulmonary nodules (nodule diameter, nodule count, upper lobe location, malignant sign at the nodule edge, subsolid status), artificial intelligence analysis of LDCT data, and liquid biopsy achieved the best diagnostic performance in the training cohort (sensitivity 89.53%, specificity 81.31%, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.880). In the independent validation cohort (n = 168), this model had an AUC of 0.895, which was greater than that of the Mayo Clinic Model (AUC = 0.772) and Veterans' Affairs Model (AUC = 0.740). These results were significantly better for predicting the presence of cancer than radiological features and artificial intelligence risk scores alone. Applying this classifier prospectively may lead to improved early lung cancer diagnosis and early treatment for patients with malignant nodules while sparing patients with benign entities from unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery.

                    "abstract": "Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.",

Further, we conducted analysis after removing genomic regions previously associated with smoking behaviors to mitigate potential confounding effects. We found significant negative genetic correlations between lung cancer risk and dietary behaviors, fitness metrics, educational attainment, and other psychosocial traits. Alcohol taken with meals (rg = - 0.41, h2 = 0.10, p = 1.33 \u00d7 10-16), increased fluid intelligence scores (rg = - 0.25, h2 = 0.22, p = 4.54 \u00d7 10-8), and the age at which full time education was completed (rg = - 0.45, h2 = 0.11, p = 1.24 \u00d7 10-20) demonstrated negative genetic correlation with lung cancer susceptibility. The body mass index was positively correlated with lung cancer risk (rg = 0.20, h2 = 0.25, p = 2.61 \u00d7 10-9). This analysis reveals shared genetic architecture between several traits and lung cancer predisposition. Future work should test for causal relationships and investigate common underlying genetic mechanisms across these genetically correlated traits.",

Very little information is available about the particular medications that are being prescribed by community mental health services and how this has changed over time. We set out to obtain details of psychiatric medications being prescribed by one Irish community mental health service. Method: All prescribing by the Cluain Mhuire Community Mental Health Service became electronic during 2004. Using Business Intelligence software, we obtained details of all psychiatric medications prescribed from 2005 to 2016. We compared numbers of prescriptions written in the first 6 years (2005-2010) with the following 6 (2011-2016). Results: Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed medication throughout but its use declined by one-quarter over the study period. Clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol prescribing increased. Prescriptions for mood stabilisers and antidepressants fell by 25%. Sedative prescriptions declined by almost 50%. Absolute numbers of prescriptions written for methylphenidate and pregabalin were small but increased dramatically over the time period. Conclusions: This community mental health service prescribed less of most psychiatric medications in 2016, than had been the case in 2005. This is despite an increase in the numbers of patients seen over the same period. It is not clear if this pattern is echoed in other services.",

                    "abstract": "Despite immunisation being one of the greatest medical success stories of the twentieth century, there is a growing lack of confidence in some vaccines. Improving communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases may help regain this lost confidence. A conference was organised at the Fondation Merieux in France to discuss what benefits could be communicated and how innovative digital initiatives can used for communication. During this meeting, a wide range of indirect benefits of vaccination were discussed. For example, influenza vaccination can reduce hospitalisations and deaths in older persons with diabetes by 45% and 38%, respectively, but the link between influenza and complications from underlying chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is frequently underestimated. Vaccination can reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is growing, by reducing the incidence of infectious disease (though direct and indirect or herd protection), by reducing the number of circulating AMR strains, and by reducing the need for antimicrobial use. Disease morbidity and treatment costs in the elderly population are likely to rise substantially, with the ageing global population. Healthy ageing and life-course vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Novel disease surveillance systems based on information from Internet search engines, mobile phone apps, social media, cloud-based electronic health records, and crowd-sourced systems, contribute to improved awareness of disease burden. Examples of the role of new techniques and tools to process data generated by multiple sources, such as artificial intelligence, to support vaccination programmes, such as influenza and dengue, were discussed. The conference participants agreed that continual efforts are needed from all stakeholders to ensure effective, transparent communication of the full benefits and risks of vaccination.",

        "answer": "#### The Benefits of Getting Vaccinated\n\nVaccination offers several important benefits:\n\n1. **Protection Against Harmful Diseases**: Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting individuals against harmful diseases before they come into contact with them. It uses the body's natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes the immune system stronger. Vaccines train the immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put individuals at risk of its complications [[1]](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination).\n\n2. **Reduction of Disease Risks**: Vaccines reduce the risks of getting a disease by working with the body's natural defenses to build protection. When an individual gets vaccinated, their immune system responds by recognizing the invading germ, producing antibodies, and building protection against the disease. This helps in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases and the number of circulating antimicrobial resistance"

This results in little to no insulin production in the body.\n\n- Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body either becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. It is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and lack of physical activity.\n\n- Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels.

                    "abstract": "Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of EDs and eating pathology in young adults and adults with ADHD and/or ASD, and to investigate the relationship between EDs and associated symptoms, on the one hand, and other psychiatric disorders, intelligence, and BMI, on the other hand, in this population. Methods: In an outpatient setting, 228 consecutively referred adults were neuropsychiatrically evaluated and assessed with regard to intelligence (WAIS-III), psychiatric comorbidities (SCID-I), personality disorders (SCID-II), eating disorders (SCID-I) and eating pathology (Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)). Results: For the entire sample, a total of 18 individuals (7.9%) had a current or previous eating disorder, with AN and BED being the most frequent. The male:female ratio was 1:2.5. According to EAT, 10.1% of the individuals scored within the range of severely disturbed eating behavior, and 13% moderately disturbed eating behavior. Individuals with ADHD more often affirmed eating pathology such as focusing on thoughts of calories and body dissatisfaction compared to individuals with ASD. Conclusions: Eating disorder symptomatology seems to be overrepresented in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders compared with the general population. The gender ratio for EDs in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders is not nearly as skewed as in the general population.",

Genomic classification of various cancers is crucial in providing oncologists with vital information for targeted therapy. Thus, it becomes more pertinent to address issues of patient genomic classification. Prostate cancer is a cancer subtype that exhibits extreme heterogeneity. Prostate cancer contributes to 7.3% of new cancer cases worldwide, with a high prevalence in males. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second most significant cause of death from cancer in women. Breast cancer is caused by abnormal cell growth in the breast tissue, generally referred to as a tumour. Tumours are not synonymous with cancer; they can be benign (noncancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) tests are used to biopsy the breast to diagnose breast cancer. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are used to diagnose with varying accuracy. In light of this, we used the Genetic Folding (GF) algorithm to predict prostate cancer status in a given dataset. An accuracy of 96% was obtained, thus being the current highest accuracy in prostate cancer diagnosis. The model was also used in breast cancer classification with a proposed pipeline that used exploratory data analysis (EDA), label encoding, feature standardization, feature decomposition, log transformation, detect and remove the outliers with Z-score, and the BAGGINGSVM approach attained a 95.96% accuracy. The accuracy of this model was then assessed using the rate of change of PSA, age, BMI, and filtration by race. We discovered that integrating the rate of change of PSA and age in our model raised the model's area under the curve (AUC) by 6.8%, whereas BMI and race had no effect. As for breast cancer classification, no features were removed.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Assessment of progress in cancer control at the population level is increasingly important. Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

This view has been challenged by evidence that many disorders are sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exist on a continuum. Using the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, we examined the structure of psychopathology, taking into account dimensionality, persistence, co-occurrence, and sequential comorbidity of mental disorders across 20 years, from adolescence to midlife. Psychiatric disorders were initially explained by three higher-order factors (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Thought Disorder) but explained even better with one General Psychopathology dimension. We have called this dimension the p factor because it conceptually parallels a familiar dimension in psychological science: the g factor of general intelligence. Higher p scores are associated with more life impairment, greater familiality, worse developmental histories, and more compromised early-life brain function. The p factor explains why it is challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders.

Evidently, it should be clearly discriminated between the standardised \"normal\" body weight and individually optimal weight. To this end, the basic principle of personalised medicine \"one size does not fit all\" has to be applied. Contextually, \"normal\" but e.g. borderline body mass index might be optimal for one person but apparently suboptimal for another one strongly depending on the individual genetic predisposition, geographic origin, cultural and nutritional habits and relevant lifestyle parameters-all included into comprehensive individual patient profile. Even if only slightly deviant, both overweight and underweight are acknowledged risk factors for a shifted metabolism which, if being not optimised, may strongly contribute to the development and progression of severe pathologies. Development of innovative screening programmes is essential to promote population health by application of health risks assessment, individualised patient profiling and multi-parametric analysis, further used for cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The following healthcare areas are considered to be potentially strongly benefiting from the above proposed measures: suboptimal health conditions, sports medicine, stress overload and associated complications, planned pregnancies, periodontal health and dentistry, sleep medicine, eye health and disorders, inflammatory disorders, healing and pain management, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, psychiatric and neurologic disorders, stroke of known and unknown aetiology, improved individual and population outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. In a long-term way, a significantly improved healthcare economy is one of benefits of the proposed paradigm shift from reactive to Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM/3PM). A tight collaboration between all stakeholders including scientific community, healthcare givers, patient organisations, policy-makers and educators is essential for the smooth implementation of 3PM concepts in daily practice.",

This damage leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and other respiratory illnesses. Smoking also increases the risk of infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. The harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke can cause inflammation and irritation in the lining of the lungs, which can lead to chronic bronchitis. In addition, smoking weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. Over time, the damage caused by smoking can lead to irreversible lung damage and breathing difficulties."

Improved Cardiovascular Function:** Regular physical activity strengthens the heart muscle, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently. This helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n**2. Weight Management:** Exercise helps in maintaining a healthy weight, which is crucial for heart health. It can also aid in reducing the risk of developing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which are detrimental to heart health.\n\n**3. Lowered Cholesterol Levels:** Physical activity can increase the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol, and decrease the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, known as \"bad\" cholesterol. This can help in reducing the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease.\n\n**4. Reduced Inflammation:** Regular exercise has been shown"

        "answer": "#### Importance of Staying Hydrated\n\nStaying hydrated is important for maintaining overall health and well-being. Here are a few reasons why staying hydrated is crucial:\n\n**1. Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps regulate body temperature through sweating and evaporation. When you are dehydrated, your body may struggle to cool down, leading to heat-related illnesses.\n\n**2. Supports Physical Performance:** Adequate hydration is essential for optimal physical performance. During exercise or physical activity, your body loses water through sweat. Dehydration can lead to decreased endurance, reduced strength, and impaired cognitive function.\n\n**3. Aids in Digestion and Nutrient Absorption:** Water plays a vital role in digestion and nutrient absorption. It helps break down food, facilitates the movement of nutrients through the digestive system, and prevents constipation.\n\n**4. Supports Kidney Function:** Proper hydration is necessary for maintaining healthy kidney function. Water helps flush out waste products and toxins from the body through urine. Insufficient hydration"

The results found support the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between emotional intelligence and mental health; nevertheless, this was not the case when personality traits were analysed. Furthermore, it has been found that EI and resilience positively affect mental health of university students. Practical implications of this study are oriented towards an advance within the emerging trend of deepening the EI and resilience constructs among mental health care providers.

Thirty-four minimally treated FEP patients from the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne, Australia, and 26 HC participants from a similar demographic area participated in the study. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery as well as the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (task-, emotion- and avoidance-focussed coping styles) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Linear regressions were used to determine the contribution of neuropsychological functioning and coping style to perceived stress in the two groups. In the FEP group, higher levels of emotion-focussed and lower levels of task-focussed coping were associated with elevated stress. Higher premorbid IQ and working memory were also associated with higher subjective stress. In the HC group, higher levels of emotion-focussed coping, and contrary to the FEP group, lower premorbid IQ, working memory and executive functioning, were associated with increased stress.

Stress is a physiological mechanism that the organism develops to adapt and survive external and internal challenges. In this context, stress tends to be seen as a negative condition in the learning process when it is chronic. Extreme stress situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can generate anxiety and frustration in students. However, other studies indicate that controlled stress can positively enhance the learning process. On the other hand, the quality and intensity of emotions resulting from stress can influence as well the learning process. Positive emotions are healthy and can promote optimal learning. Emotions lead to sentimental, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological changes, which will have a strong influence on intellectual performance. The activation of coping strategies constitutes a key mechanism for dealing positively with problems and challenges, generating positive emotions essential for the self-regulation of learning. In conclusion, correct management of emotions in stressful situations could promote effective learning through enhanced attention and capacity to solve problems.",

Research design and methods: In this ecological study, based on 192 countries, data on per capita sugar consumption were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on BMI from the World Health Organization and on diabetes prevalence from the International Diabetes Federation. Data on demography and economic factors were obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency, the United Nations and the FAO. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association. Results: Each increase of 100 kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: - 0.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion.

Research design and methods: In this ecological study, based on 192 countries, data on per capita sugar consumption were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on BMI from the World Health Organization and on diabetes prevalence from the International Diabetes Federation. Data on demography and economic factors were obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency, the United Nations and the FAO. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association. Results: Each increase of 100 kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: - 0.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion. However, it seems that other mechanisms may explain the association between sugar consumption and development of type 2 diabetes.",

However, it is important to note that the association between sugar consumption and diabetes may not be solely explained by BMI, as there may be other mechanisms at play. \n\nRegarding the combination of a sedentary lifestyle and a high-sugar diet, it is known that physical inactivity can also contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance, which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the combination of a sedentary lifestyle and a high-sugar diet may further increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes through their individual and potentially synergistic effects on body weight, insulin sensitivity, and overall metabolic health."

                    "abstract": "Background: In adult chronic kidney disease (CKD), metabolic acidosis is associated with diminished cognition, notably executive function (EF). Data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study demonstrate a risk for impairment of EF, a finding associated with heightened blood pressure variability (BPV). We sought to determine whether low serum bicarbonate is also associated with performance on tests of EF in pediatric CKD and to investigate potential interaction with BPV. Methods: CKiD participants with serum bicarbonate, blood pressure, and selected cognitive measurements available were evaluated. An EF summary score was derived from scores on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Conners' Continuous Performance Test, and Digit Span Backwards subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV-Integrated. Parents completed the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to yield a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score. Linear mixed models with bicarbonate and hypertension as predictors and linear regression with bicarbonate and BPV were used to predict EF level. Results: Data were available for 865 children. Twenty-two percent had low bicarbonate (CO2 \u2264 20 mmol/L) at baseline. On multivariate analysis, there was no relationship between bicarbonate, hypertension, and EF. There was no significant CO2\u00d7hypertension interaction found. A significant interaction (p = 0.01) between high CO2 (\u2265 26 mmol/L) and BPV was detected in the model with GEC as the EF outcome, indicating that while higher BPV was associated with worse EF in the low and normal CO2 groups, higher BPV was associated with better EF in the high CO2 group. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed an interaction between one measure of BPV and low bicarbonate on neurocognition in pediatric CKD, suggesting a potential role for control of both bicarbonate and blood pressure in preserving cognition in early CKD. Further research is needed to confirm and further define this association.",

It is unclear whether this association between mental health and CHD is present across a wider range of mental disorders. Methods and results: Participants were 1 107 524 Swedish men conscripted at a mean age of 18.3 years. Mental disorders were assessed by psychiatric interview on conscription, and data on hospital admissions for mental disorder and CHD were obtained from national registers during 22.6 years of follow-up. An increased risk of incident CHD was evident across a range of mental disorders whether diagnosed at conscription or on later hospital admission. Age-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) according to diagnoses at conscription ranged from 1.30 (1.05, 1.62) (depressive disorders) to 1.90 (1.58, 2.38) (alcohol-related disorders). [corrected]. The equivalent figures according to diagnoses during hospital admission ranged from 1.49 (1.24-1.80) (schizophrenia) to 2.82 (2.53-3.13) (other substance use disorders). Associations were little changed by adjustment for parental socioeconomic status, or body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and blood pressure measured at conscription, but they were partially attenuated by the adjustment for smoking, alcohol intake, and intelligence measured at conscription, and for education and own socioeconomic position. Conclusions: Increased risk of incident CHD is present across a range of mental disorders and is observable when the disorders are diagnosed at a young age.",

For example, chronic stress associated with mental health disorders can lead to an overactivation of the body's stress response system, resulting in the release of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can contribute to inflammation, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system.\n\nAdditionally, individuals with untreated mental health disorders may engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, poor diet, lack of exercise, and inadequate sleep, which can further exacerbate physical health problems.\n\nFurthermore, mental health disorders can directly impact specific physiological systems. For example, depression has been linked to alterations in the autonomic nervous system, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anxiety disorders have been associated with increased levels of cortisol, which can affect metabolism and immune function. Psychotic disorders can lead to disruptions in neuroendocrine function, potentially affecting various bodily systems.\n\nOverall, untreated mental health disorders can have a significant impact on a person's physical"

        "answer": "Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to several potential health risks, including gastrointestinal issues such as ulcers, bleeding, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. NSAIDs can also affect kidney function, potentially leading to kidney damage or failure. Additionally, prolonged use of NSAIDs may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes. It is important to use NSAIDs under the guidance of a healthcare professional and to follow recommended dosages to minimize these risks."

        "context": [],
        "answer": "The body's immune response to a vaccine is similar to its response to an actual infection in that both scenarios involve the activation of the immune system to produce specific antibodies and memory cells that can recognize and fight off the pathogen. \n\nHowever, there are some key differences between the two responses. In the case of a vaccine, the antigen (part of the pathogen that triggers an immune response) is usually weakened or inactivated, so it does not cause the full-blown disease. This allows the immune system to mount a response without the individual getting sick. \n\nOn the other hand, in a natural infection, the body is exposed to the full strength of the pathogen, leading to more intense and potentially harmful symptoms as the immune system works to eliminate the invader.\n\nAdditionally, vaccines are designed to specifically target certain pathogens, while natural infections can involve a wider range of immune responses and potential complications."

Gases, particulate matter, organic compounds but also allergens and viruses, fall within the 'pollutant' definition. Distinct populations, such as children and allergy and asthma sufferers are highly susceptible, while a low socioeconomic background is a further susceptibility factor; however, no specific guidance is available. We spend most of our time indoors; for children, the school environment is of paramount importance and potentially amenable to intervention. The interactions between some pollutant classes have been studied. However, a lot is missing with respect to understanding interactions between specific pollutants of different classes in terms of concentrations, timing and sequence, to improve targeting and upgrade standards. SynAir-G is a European Commission-funded project aiming to reveal and quantify synergistic interactions between different pollutants affecting health, from mechanisms to real life, focusing on the school setting. It will develop a comprehensive and responsive multipollutant monitoring system, advance environmentally friendly interventions, and disseminate the generated knowledge to relevant stakeholders in accessible and actionable formats.

We decided to assess studies that evaluated the relationship between air pollution and cognitive functions in children and adolescents by reviewing studies that had been published between January 2009 and May 2019. We searched three major databases for original works (26 studies) and for studies using brain imaging methods based on MRI (six studies). Adverse effects of air pollutants on selected cognitive or psychomotor functions were found in all of the studies. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide, for example, was linked to impaired working memory, general cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions; particulate matter 2.5 was linked to difficulties in working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, and fine motor function; black carbon was linked to poor verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory; airborne copper was linked to impaired attentiveness and fine motor skills; isophorone was linked to lower mathematical skills; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fetal life were linked to lower intelligence scores. The studies using MRI showed that high concentrations of air pollutants were linked to changes in the brain's white matter or lower functional integration and segregation in children's brain networks. In view of the global increase in air pollution, there is a need for further research to elucidate the relationship between air pollution and cognitive and motor development in children. According to some studies, neuroinflammation, the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and gutathione-S-transferase gene polymorphism processes may play a role.",

It can lead to various respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and even lung cancer. Additionally, air pollution can exacerbate existing respiratory conditions and lead to cardiorespiratory diseases. Prolonged exposure to air pollutants can also result in irreversible damage to the respiratory system, leading to long-term health issues and decreased quality of life."

Methods: We conducted a hypothesis-free analysis combining machine learning and statistical approaches to identify cancer risk factors from 2828 potential predictors captured at baseline. There were 459,169 UK Biobank participants free from cancer at baseline and 48,671 new cancer cases during the 10-year follow-up. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index and skin colour (as a proxy for sun sensitivity) were used for obtaining adjusted odds ratios, with continuous predictors presented using quintiles (Q). Results: In addition to smoking, older age and male sex, positively associating features included several anthropometric characteristics, whole body water mass, pulse, hypertension and biomarkers such as urinary microalbumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.16, 95% CI = 1.13-1.19), C-reactive protein (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.20, 95% CI = 1.16-1.24) and red blood cell distribution width (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.18, 95% CI = 1.14-1.21), among others. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) and albumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) were inversely associated with cancer. In sex-stratified analyses, higher testosterone increased the risk in females but not in males (Q5 vs. Q1 ORfemales 1.23, 95% CI = 1.17-1.30). Phosphate was associated with a lower risk in females but a higher risk in males (Q5 vs. Q1 ORfemales 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.99 vs. ORmales 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15). Conclusions: This hypothesis-free analysis suggests personal characteristics, metabolic biomarkers, physical measures and smoking as important predictors of cancer risk, with further studies needed to confirm causality and clinical relevance.",

Advances in machine learning and big data generated from genetic sequencing can now be used for predicting BC pathogenicity. However, it is unclear which tool developed for pathogenicity prediction is most suited for predicting the impact and pathogenicity of variant effects. A significant challenge is to determine the most suitable data source for each tool since different tools can yield different prediction results with different data inputs. To this end, this work reviews genetic variant databases and tools used specifically for the prediction of BC pathogenicity. We provide a description of existing genetic variants databases and, where appropriate, the diseases for which they have been established. Through example, we illustrate how they can be used for prediction of BC pathogenicity and discuss their associated advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the tools that are specialized by training on multiple diverse datasets from different databases for the same disease have enhanced accuracy and specificity and are thereby more helpful to the clinicians in predicting and diagnosing BC as early as possible.",
