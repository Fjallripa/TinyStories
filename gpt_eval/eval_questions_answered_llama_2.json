        "answer": "Healio: Yes, diabetes is a chronic disease. According to the PubMed abstracts provided, diabetes is defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body regulates blood sugar levels. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can cause damage to the body over time if left untreated. The disease can also lead to a range of complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and vision loss. Therefore, it is important for individuals with diabetes to manage their condition effectively through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and exercise, and/or medication to control blood sugar levels.",

We carried out a survey of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among homeless men in Nagoya, Japan, and assessed the associations between diabetes prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics. Materials and methods: Interviews relating to individuals' sociodemographic background, mental illness and cognitive ability, and blood sampling were carried out for 106 homeless men (mean age 54.2 \u00b1 12.7 years). Diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia were diagnosed according to the individual's hemoglobin A1c level: \u22656.5%, 6.4-6.0% and \u22645.9%, respectively. Mental illness and cognitive disability were diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, respectively. Associations between the prevalence of diabetes/prediabetes and mental illness/cognitive disability or sociodemographic background were analyzed using the \u03c72 -test. Results: Seven (6.6%) and 12 (11.3%) participants were diagnosed as having diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, which was a similar trend to that of general populations in Japan National Health and Nutrition Survey data. There was a significant difference in the prediabetes prevalence between groups with and without a history of having social support; however, no significant associations were found between the diabetes/prediabetes prevalence and mental illness/cognitive ability or participants' sociodemographic background. Conclusions: The incidence of diabetes in Japanese homeless men was similar to that in the general population, and the prediabetes incidence was lower in the group with social support than in that without. Early intervention for preventing diabetes and social support that focuses on diabetes management is important for homeless people.",

                    "abstract": "Background: The present study aimed to investigate the knowledge level of Bard and ChatGPT in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology through a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination format. Methods: Initially, a 100-MCQ bank was established based on MCQs in endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology. The MCQs were created from physiology, medical textbooks, and academic examination pools in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology and academic examination pools. The study team members analyzed the MCQ contents to ensure that they were related to the endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology. The number of MCQs from endocrinology was 50, and that from diabetes and science technology was also 50. The knowledge level of Google's Bard and ChatGPT was assessed with an MCQ-based examination. Results: In the endocrinology examination section, ChatGPT obtained 29 marks (correct responses) of 50 (58%), and Bard obtained a similar score of 29 of 50 (58%). However, in the diabetes technology examination section, ChatGPT obtained 23 marks of 50 (46%), and Bard obtained 20 marks of 50 (40%). Overall, in the entire three-part examination, ChatGPT obtained 52 marks of 100 (52%), and Bard obtained 49 marks of 100 (49%). ChatGPT obtained slightly more marks than Bard. However, both ChatGPT and Bard did not achieve satisfactory scores in endocrinology or diabetes/technology of at least 60%. Conclusions: The overall MCQ-based performance of ChatGPT was slightly better than that of Google's Bard. However, both ChatGPT and Bard did not achieve appropriate scores in endocrinology and diabetes/diabetes technology. The study indicates that Bard and ChatGPT have the potential to facilitate medical students and faculty in academic medical education settings, but both artificial intelligence tools need more updated information in the fields of endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology.",

We carried out a survey of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among homeless men in Nagoya, Japan, and assessed the associations between diabetes prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics. Materials and methods: Interviews relating to individuals' sociodemographic background, mental illness and cognitive ability, and blood sampling were carried out for 106 homeless men (mean age 54.2 \u00b1 12.7 years). Diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia were diagnosed according to the individual's hemoglobin A1c level: \u22656.5%, 6.4-6.0% and \u22645.9%, respectively. Mental illness and cognitive disability were diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, respectively. Associations between the prevalence of diabetes/prediabetes and mental illness/cognitive disability or sociodemographic background were analyzed using the \u03c72 -test. Results: Seven (6.6%) and 12 (11.3%) participants were diagnosed as having diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, which was a similar trend to that of general populations in Japan National Health and Nutrition Survey data. There was a significant difference in the prediabetes prevalence between groups with and without a history of having social support; however, no significant associations were found between the diabetes/prediabetes prevalence and mental illness/cognitive ability or participants' sociodemographic background. Conclusions: The incidence of diabetes in Japanese homeless men was similar to that in the general population, and the prediabetes incidence was lower in the group with social support than in that without. Early intervention for preventing diabetes and social support that focuses on diabetes management is important for homeless people.",

Studies have consistently found that aerobic exercise, in particular, can lower the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) by improving cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance. Additionally, resistance training can also have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. It is important to note that the relationship between exercise and heart disease is complex and multifaceted, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which exercise reduces the risk of heart disease. (Based on: objective: education is inversely associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; however, the mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. | objective: the present study investigates exercise training, particularly emphasizing the current recommendations and the mutually beneficial effects of aerobic and resistance regimens. | purpose: to derive and validate a single metric of activity tracking that associates with lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.)",

The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method: The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant indirect effects for reading comprehension in women (7.2%; 95% CI [0.7, 19.4]) and men (7.2%; 95% CI [0.8, 19.1]), and depressive symptoms (11.8%; 95% CI [2.5, 26.6]) and perceived constraint (6.7%, 95% CI [0.7, 19.1]) in women. Conclusions: Evidence suggested that reading comprehension in women and men, and depressive symptoms and perceived constraint in women, may mediate some of the association between education and CHD risk. If these mediated effects are interpreted causally, interventions targeting reading, depressive symptoms, and perceived constraint could reduce educational inequalities in CHD.",

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

Methods: We derived an algorithm, Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), using the HUNT Fitness Study (n = 4631), and validated it in the general HUNT population (n = 39,298) aged 20-74 years. The PAI was divided into three sex-specific groups (\u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100), and the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the referent. Hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regressions. Results: After >1 million person-years of observations during a mean follow-up time of 26.2 (SD 5.9) years, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 women) from cardiovascular disease. Men and women with a PAI level \u2265100 had 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-27%) and 23% (95% CI, 4%-38%) reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively, compared with the inactive groups. Obtaining \u2265100 PAI was associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease mortality in all prespecified age groups, and in participants with known cardiovascular disease risk factors (all P-trends <.01). Participants who did not obtain \u2265100 PAI had increased risk of dying regardless of meeting the physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: PAI may have a huge potential to motivate people to become and stay physically active, as it is an easily understandable and scientifically proven metric that could inform potential users of how much physical activity is needed to reduce the risk of premature cardiovascular disease death.",

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

Here, we prospectively investigated the association between PAI and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in a large healthy population from China. Methods: Using data from the China Kadoorie Biobank, we studied 443,792 healthy adults (60% women). The weekly PAI score of each participant was estimated based on the questionnaire data and divided into four groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, or \u2265100). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for fatal IHD and nonfatal myocardial infraction (MI) related to PAI were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Results: There were 3050 IHD deaths and 1808 MI events during a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range, 7.3-9.1; 3.6 million person-years). After adjustments for multiple confounders, a weekly PAI score \u2265 100 was associated with a lower risk of IHD (aHR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-1.00)), compared with the inactive group (0 PAI). The corresponding aHR for MI was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-1.05). In participants aged 60 years or older at baseline, the aHR associated with a weekly PAI score \u2265 100 was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75-0.93) for IHD and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98) for MI. Conclusion: Among healthy Chinese adults, a weekly PAI score of 100 or greater was associated with a lower risk of IHD mortality across all age groups; moreover, a high PAI score significantly lowered the risk of MI but only in those 60 years and older at baseline. The present findings extend the scientific evidence that PAI may have prognostic significance in diverse settings for IHD outcomes and suggest that the PAI metric may be useful in delineating the magnitude of weekly physical activity needed to reduce the risk of IHD mortality.",

Methods: We derived an algorithm, Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), using the HUNT Fitness Study (n = 4631), and validated it in the general HUNT population (n = 39,298) aged 20-74 years. The PAI was divided into three sex-specific groups (\u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100), and the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the referent. Hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regressions. Results: After >1 million person-years of observations during a mean follow-up time of 26.2 (SD 5.9) years, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 women) from cardiovascular disease. Men and women with a PAI level \u2265100 had 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-27%) and 23% (95% CI, 4%-38%) reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively, compared with the inactive groups. Obtaining \u2265100 PAI was associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease mortality in all prespecified age groups, and in participants with known cardiovascular disease risk factors (all P-trends <.01). Participants who did not obtain \u2265100 PAI had increased risk of dying regardless of meeting the physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: PAI may have a huge potential to motivate people to become and stay physically active, as it is an easily understandable and scientifically proven metric that could inform potential users of how much physical activity is needed to reduce the risk of premature cardiovascular disease death.",

        "answer": "Healio: Asthma is indeed considered a respiratory condition. According to the background information in the PubMed abstracts provided, asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that can cause recurring episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The airways in people with asthma are inflamed and sensitive, which can lead to narrowing of the airways and difficulty breathing. Respiratory conditions are disorders that affect the respiratory system, which includes the lungs, trachea, bronchi, and alveoli. Asthma is one such condition that is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.",

                    "abstract": "Background: The incidence of asthma in Chinese children has rapidly increased as a result of inadequate management. This is mainly due to the failure of many primary-level pediatricians to distinguish asthma from common respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Such misdiagnoses often lead to the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids. Additionally, if asthma is not diagnosed early, chronic airway inflammation results in lesions that not only hamper children's athletic abilities, but serve as the primary cause for adult chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A number of machine learning-based models including CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed to identify asthma via utilizing retrospective electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients. These models were evaluated independently using EMRs from both the Pulmonology Department and other departments of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China. Results: Two independent test sets were applied for performance evaluation. TestSet-1 consisted of 325 positive asthma cases and 428 negative cases from the Pulmonology Department. TestSet-2 was composed of 2,123 cases from non-pulmonology departments, and included 337 positive and 1,786 negative cases. Experimental results showed that the CatBoost model outperformed other models on both test sets with an accuracy of 84.7% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.9% on TestSet-1, and an accuracy of 96.7% and an AUC of 98.1% on TestSet-2. Conclusions: The artificial intelligence (AI) model could rapidly and accurately identify asthma in general medical wards of children, and may aid primary pediatricians in the correct diagnoses of asthma. It possesses great clinical value and practical significance in improving the control rate of asthma in children, optimizing medical resources, and limiting the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids.",

A number of activities in children with asthma may be affected by asthmatic attacks including their education/academic performance. Report on academic performance and IQ of school children with asthma and comparisons with those without asthma (controls) within and outside Nigeria are scanty. Aims: This study compared the academic performance and IQ of asthmatics and nonasthmatic school children. Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty children with asthma aged 5-11 years were consecutively recruited at the asthma clinic of UNTH Enugu and their age, gender and socio-economic class-matched normal classmates were enrolled as controls. Academic performance of the children with asthma was studied using the overall scores achieved in the three term examinations in the preceding academic year (2012/2013), while their IQ was determined using the Draw-A-Person-test. The findings were compared with that of the 120 controls. Results: The median (range) overall academic scores for the subjects 79.04% (36.08%-99.57%) was similar to that of controls 80.01% (50.65%-97.47%) (U = 6804, P = 0.461). However, a significant number of subjects compared to controls had poor academic performance. The mean IQ scores for subjects (123.28 \u00b1 21.45) and controls (118.41 \u00b1 19.87) did not differ significantly (t = 1.83; P = 0.069). There was also a significant and negative correlation (Pearson's) between age and mean DAPQ in both the subjects and controls (r = -0.377, P < 0.001; r = -0.492, P < 0.001 respectively.

Asthmatic children classified as NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+ showed earlier onset asthma, more Th2-high profile, poorer lung function, higher asthma exacerbation and higher risk of asthma-associated comorbidities compared with other groups. These results were consistent with those based on unsupervised cluster analysis and lab and PFT data of a random sample of study subjects. Conclusion: Expert AI-based NLP algorithms for two asthma criteria systematically identify childhood asthma with distinctive characteristics. This approach may improve precision, reproducibility, consistency and efficiency of large-scale clinical studies for asthma and enable population management.",

Currently, phenotypes of the disease are distinguished. One of the original decisions in phenotypes distinguishing is the use of cluster analysis. However, the concept of BA phenotypes at the health resort period of rehabilitation has not yet been formed. Aim: To determine the BA phenotypes upon admission of patients to a health resort medical rehabilitation (HRMR) using cluster analysis and to offer personalized rehabilitation programs. Material and methods: 518 patients with asthma who underwent HRMR on the southern coast of Crimea were examined. Each patient received clinical, functional and laboratory examination. HRMR included correction of long-term treatment according to the severity of asthma, climate therapy, respiratory therapy, educational programs, and physiotherapeutic procedures. We applied cluster analysis in order to identify BA phenotypes. Description statistics methods were used for phenotype-cluster characterization, comparative analysis - for determination of reliable phenotypic characteristics and relation of the effectiveness of HRMR and phenotypes. Results: A model of three phenotype-clusters was developed. The first cluster included patients with BA of moderate severity, uncontrolled course, frequent exacerbations, history of atopy, a tendency to obesity, moderately reduced external respiration function, fixed airway obstruction, high adherence to long-term therapy with medium doses of inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) combined with long-acting \u03b2-2 agonists (LABA). Cluster 2 included patients with mild asthma, controlled or partially controlled course of the disease, with rare short exacerbations, late onset, preserved external respiration function and exercise tolerance, but low adherence to long-term therapy with medium and low doses of ICS. Cluster 3 included patients with moderate to severe BA, uncontrolled course, with early onset, frequent and prolonged exacerbations, severe symptoms, significantly reduced external respiration function with fixed obstruction, decreased exercise tolerance, but low adherence to long-term therapy (4th stage) with high doses of ICS in combination with LABA and long-acting anticholinergics. A close relationship was found between phenotypes-clusters and the achieved effects: a significant increase in the control of BA and a high efficiency of rehabilitation in patients of the 1st and especially 3rd clusters and low in the 2nd cluster. The optimal rehabilitation programs for each of the selected cluster phenotypes were determined. Conclusion: The cluster model developed with the help of artificial intelligence has demonstrated high prognostic value in the determination of the effectiveness and change of control over the course of asthma as a result of HRMR. Personalized HRMR programs are suggested.",

This is mainly due to the failure of many primary-level pediatricians to distinguish asthma from common respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Such misdiagnoses often lead to the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids. Additionally, if asthma is not diagnosed early, chronic airway inflammation results in lesions that not only hamper children's athletic abilities, but serve as the primary cause for adult chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A number of machine learning-based models including CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed to identify asthma via utilizing retrospective electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients. These models were evaluated independently using EMRs from both the Pulmonology Department and other departments of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China. Results: Two independent test sets were applied for performance evaluation. TestSet-1 consisted of 325 positive asthma cases and 428 negative cases from the Pulmonology Department. TestSet-2 was composed of 2,123 cases from non-pulmonology departments, and included 337 positive and 1,786 negative cases. Experimental results showed that the CatBoost model outperformed other models on both test sets with an accuracy of 84.7% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.9% on TestSet-1, and an accuracy of 96.7% and an AUC of 98.1% on TestSet-2. Conclusions: The artificial intelligence (AI) model could rapidly and accurately identify asthma in general medical wards of children, and may aid primary pediatricians in the correct diagnoses of asthma. It possesses great clinical value and practical significance in improving the control rate of asthma in children, optimizing medical resources, and limiting the abuse of antibiotics and systemic glucocorticoids.",

Currently, phenotypes of the disease are distinguished. One of the original decisions in phenotypes distinguishing is the use of cluster analysis. However, the concept of BA phenotypes at the health resort period of rehabilitation has not yet been formed. Aim: To determine the BA phenotypes upon admission of patients to a health resort medical rehabilitation (HRMR) using cluster analysis and to offer personalized rehabilitation programs. Material and methods: 518 patients with asthma who underwent HRMR on the southern coast of Crimea were examined. Each patient received clinical, functional and laboratory examination. HRMR included correction of long-term treatment according to the severity of asthma, climate therapy, respiratory therapy, educational programs, and physiotherapeutic procedures. We applied cluster analysis in order to identify BA phenotypes. Description statistics methods were used for phenotype-cluster characterization, comparative analysis - for determination of reliable phenotypic characteristics and relation of the effectiveness of HRMR and phenotypes. Results: A model of three phenotype-clusters was developed. The first cluster included patients with BA of moderate severity, uncontrolled course, frequent exacerbations, history of atopy, a tendency to obesity, moderately reduced external respiration function, fixed airway obstruction, high adherence to long-term therapy with medium doses of inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) combined with long-acting \u03b2-2 agonists (LABA). Cluster 2 included patients with mild asthma, controlled or partially controlled course of the disease, with rare short exacerbations, late onset, preserved external respiration function and exercise tolerance, but low adherence to long-term therapy with medium and low doses of ICS. Cluster 3 included patients with moderate to severe BA, uncontrolled course, with early onset, frequent and prolonged exacerbations, severe symptoms, significantly reduced external respiration function with fixed obstruction, decreased exercise tolerance, but low adherence to long-term therapy (4th stage) with high doses of ICS in combination with LABA and long-acting anticholinergics. A close relationship was found between phenotypes-clusters and the achieved effects: a significant increase in the control of BA and a high efficiency of rehabilitation in patients of the 1st and especially 3rd clusters and low in the 2nd cluster. The optimal rehabilitation programs for each of the selected cluster phenotypes were determined. Conclusion: The cluster model developed with the help of artificial intelligence has demonstrated high prognostic value in the determination of the effectiveness and change of control over the course of asthma as a result of HRMR. Personalized HRMR programs are suggested.",

We aimed to assess whether application of expert artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for two existing asthma criteria to electronic health records of a paediatric population systematically identifies childhood asthma and its subgroups with distinctive characteristics. Methods: Using the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort, we applied validated NLP algorithms for Predetermined Asthma Criteria (NLP-PAC) as well as Asthma Predictive Index (NLP-API). We categorised subjects into four groups (both criteria positive (NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+); PAC positive only (NLP-PAC+ only); API positive only (NLP-API+ only); and both criteria negative (NLP-PAC-/NLP-API-)) and characterised them. Results were replicated in unsupervised cluster analysis for asthmatics and a random sample of 300 children using laboratory and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Results: Of the 8196 subjects (51% male, 80% white), we identified 1614 (20%), NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+; 954 (12%), NLP-PAC+ only; 105 (1%), NLP-API+ only; and 5523 (67%), NLP-PAC-/NLP-API-. Asthmatic children classified as NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+ showed earlier onset asthma, more Th2-high profile, poorer lung function, higher asthma exacerbation and higher risk of asthma-associated comorbidities compared with other groups. These results were consistent with those based on unsupervised cluster analysis and lab and PFT data of a random sample of study subjects. Conclusion: Expert AI-based NLP algorithms for two asthma criteria systematically identify childhood asthma with distinctive characteristics. This approach may improve precision, reproducibility, consistency and efficiency of large-scale clinical studies for asthma and enable population management.",

Cases were identified from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU) during 2000-2015 and controls from the general population. Smoking and SES were obtained from data linkage with other national databases. The association of smoking status and SES on the incidence of melanoma were assessed using binary logistic regression. Multivariate survival analysis was performed on a melanoma cohort using a Cox proportional hazard model using survival as the outcome. Results: During 2000-2015, 9636 patients developed melanoma. Smoking data were obtained for 7124 (73\u00b79%) of these patients. There were 26 408 controls identified from the general population. Smoking was inversely associated with melanoma incidence [odds ratio (OR) 0\u00b770, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b765-0\u00b776]. Smoking was associated with an increased overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1\u00b730, 95% CI 1\u00b709-1\u00b755], but not associated with melanoma-specific mortality.

Many negative impacts of smoking on muscles are likely reversible with smoking cessation. Objectives: To determine if the progression of skeletal muscle fat infiltration with aging is altered by smoking cessation among lung cancer screening participants. Methods: This was a secondary analysis based on the National Lung Screening Trial. Skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield unit (HU) was derived from the baseline and follow-up low-dose CT scans using a previously validated artificial intelligence algorithm. Lower attenuation indicates greater fatty infiltration. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to evaluate the associations between smoking status and the muscle attenuation trajectory. Measurements and main results: Of 19,019 included participants (age: 61 years, 5 [SD]; 11,290 males), 8,971 (47.2%) were actively smoking cigarettes. Accounting for body mass index, pack-years, percent emphysema, and other confounding factors, actively smoking predicted a lower attenuation in both males (\u03b20 =-0.88 HU, P<.001) and females (\u03b20 =-0.69 HU, P<.001), and an accelerated muscle attenuation decline-rate in males (\u03b21=-0.08 HU/y, P<.05). Age-stratified analyses indicated that the accelerated muscle attenuation decline associated with smoking likely occurred at younger age, especially in females. Conclusions: Among lung cancer screening participants, active cigarette smoking was associated with greater skeletal muscle fat infiltration in both males and females, and accelerated muscle adipose accumulation rate in males. These findings support the important role of smoking cessation in preserving muscle health.",

Furthermore, we sought to determine the implications of smoking and SES on survival. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study. Cases were identified from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU) during 2000-2015 and controls from the general population. Smoking and SES were obtained from data linkage with other national databases. The association of smoking status and SES on the incidence of melanoma were assessed using binary logistic regression. Multivariate survival analysis was performed on a melanoma cohort using a Cox proportional hazard model using survival as the outcome. Results: During 2000-2015, 9636 patients developed melanoma. Smoking data were obtained for 7124 (73\u00b79%) of these patients. There were 26 408 controls identified from the general population. Smoking was inversely associated with melanoma incidence [odds ratio (OR) 0\u00b770, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b765-0\u00b776]. Smoking was associated with an increased overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1\u00b730, 95% CI 1\u00b709-1\u00b755], but not associated with melanoma-specific mortality. Patients with higher SES had an increased association with melanoma incidence (OR 1\u00b758, 95% CI 1\u00b744-1\u00b773). Higher SES was associated with an increased chance of both overall (HR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b781) and disease-specific survival (HR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b790). Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated that smoking appeared to be associated with reduced incidence of melanoma. Although smoking increases overall mortality, no association was observed with melanoma-specific mortality. Further work is required to determine if there is a biological mechanism underlying this relationship or an alternative explanation, such as survival bias. What's already known about this topic? Previous studies have been contradictory with both negative and positive associations between smoking and the incidence of melanoma reported. Previous studies have either been limited by publication bias because of selective reporting or underpowered. What does this study add? Our large study identified an inverse association between smoking status and melanoma incidence. Although smoking status was negatively associated with overall disease survival, no significant association was noted in melanoma-specific survival. Socioeconomic status remains closely associated with melanoma. Although higher socioeconomic populations are more likely to develop the disease, patients with lower socioeconomic status continue to have a worse prognosis.",

        "answer": "Healio: \nBased on the information derived from the PubMed abstracts, there is a strong association between obesity (measured by body mass index or BMI) and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Multiple studies have found that obesity is a significant mediator of the association between sugar consumption and T2D prevalence. Specifically, the findings suggest that obesity explains a large proportion of the observed association between sugar intake and T2D risk. However, other mechanisms may also play a role in this association, such as genetic factors or other lifestyle factors. It is important to note that these findings are based on cross-sectional analyses and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the complex relationship between obesity, sugar consumption, and T2D risk.",

Research design and methods: In this ecological study, based on 192 countries, data on per capita sugar consumption were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on BMI from the World Health Organization and on diabetes prevalence from the International Diabetes Federation. Data on demography and economic factors were obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency, the United Nations and the FAO. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association. Results: Each increase of 100 kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: - 0.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion. However, it seems that other mechanisms may explain the association between sugar consumption and development of type 2 diabetes.",

Data on demography and economic factors were obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency, the United Nations and the FAO. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association. Results: Each increase of 100 kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: - 0.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion.

The studies identified in the abstracts found that elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, with a higher risk observed in individuals with lower education levels, smaller socioeconomic status (SES), and lower intelligence quotient (IQ).\n\nOne of the studies found that the risk of stroke increased with lower education levels, with an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.24-1.48) for every 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure. Another study found that six out of 21 cognitive endpoints were associated with blood pressure, including stroke.\n\nAdditionally, a Mendelian randomization analysis found significant associations between systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure with stroke risk. These findings suggest that high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke and that efforts to manage and control blood pressure levels can help reduce the risk of stroke.\n\nIt is important to note that these findings are based on observational studies and do not prove causality, but they suggest a strong association between high blood pressure and stroke risk. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal blood pressure targets for stroke prevention.",

Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ). Methods: We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood/premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. Results: We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 164,683 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.48), SES (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.46), and IQ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method. Conclusions: Education, childhood SES, and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.

Methods: We examined the association between BP measured at the ages of 12-15 years in school surveys and cognitive endpoints measured in the Seychelles Child Development Study at ages 17 (n = 407) and 19 (n = 429) years, respectively. We evaluated multiple domains of cognition based on subtests of the Cambridge Neurological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), the Woodcock Johnson Test of Scholastic Achievement (WJTA), the Finger Tapping test (FT) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT). We used age, sex and height-specific z-scores of SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Results: Six out of the 21 cognitive endpoints tested were associated with BP. However, none of these associations were found to hold for both males and females or for different subtests within the same neurodevelopmental domain or for both SBP and DBP. Most of these associations disappeared when analyses were adjusted for selected potential confounding factors such as socio-economic status, birth weight, gestational age, BMI, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, and total n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fats.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between SAH and the components of executive functions (EF), inhibitory control (IC), updating and shifting, comparing a control group (without SAH) to patients with SAH, in two levels of severity. Methods: The protocol included the following tests to evaluate EF components: T.O.V.A. Test (IC), Backward Digit Span from Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Phonemic and Semantic Verbal Fluency (updating), and Trail Making Test Part B (shifting). Results: A total of 204 participants was included: 56 from the Control Group (CG), 87 SAH stage 1, and 61 SAH stage 2. The groups were not different for age (52.37\u00b112.29) and education (10.98\u00b14.06). As to controlled blood pressure (BP), duration of hypertension treatment and number of drugs, the SAH 2 group had a worse BP control, longer duration of hypertension treatment and use of more drugs when compared to the SAH 1. The findings revealed that patients with more severe hypertension presented worse performance in updating (Backward Digit Span, phonemic and semantics VF) and shifting (Trail Making Test Part B). Conclusion: The results suggest that patients with SAH have a significant impairment in EF, more specifically in updating and shifting. Besides that, such damage may be directly proportional to the severity of SAH. It is suggested that future studies include neuroimaging exams to exclude possible cerebrovascular diseases.",

We evaluated multiple domains of cognition based on subtests of the Cambridge Neurological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), the Woodcock Johnson Test of Scholastic Achievement (WJTA), the Finger Tapping test (FT) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT). We used age, sex and height-specific z-scores of SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Results: Six out of the 21 cognitive endpoints tested were associated with BP. However, none of these associations were found to hold for both males and females or for different subtests within the same neurodevelopmental domain or for both SBP and DBP. Most of these associations disappeared when analyses were adjusted for selected potential confounding factors such as socio-economic status, birth weight, gestational age, BMI, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, and total n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fats. Conclusions: Our findings do not support a consistent association between BP and subsequent performance on tests assessing various cognitive domains in adolescents.",

Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ). Methods: We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood/premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. Results: We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 164,683 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.48), SES (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.46), and IQ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method. Conclusions: Education, childhood SES, and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.

However, the functional and structural changes in the brain that mediate the relationship between BP elevation and cognitive impairment remain unknown. Using observational and genetic data from large consortia, this study aimed to identify brain structures potentially associated with BP values and cognitive function. Methods and results: Data on BP were integrated with 3935 brain magnetic resonance imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and cognitive function defined by fluid intelligence score. Observational analyses were performed in the UK Biobank and a prospective validation cohort. Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses used genetic data derived from the UK Biobank, International Consortium for Blood Pressure, and COGENT consortium. Mendelian randomisation analysis identified a potentially adverse causal effect of higher systolic BP on cognitive function [-0.044 standard deviation (SD); 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.066, -0.021] with the MR estimate strengthening (-0.087 SD; 95% CI -0.132, -0.042), when further adjusted for diastolic BP. Mendelian randomisation analysis found 242, 168, and 68 IDPs showing significant (false discovery rate P < 0.05) association with systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure, respectively. Most of these IDPs were inversely associated with cognitive function in observational analysis in the UK Biobank and showed concordant effects in the validation cohort. Mendelian randomisation analysis identified relationships between cognitive function and the nine of the systolic BP-associated IDPs, including the anterior thalamic radiation, anterior corona radiata, or external capsule. Conclusion: Complementary MR and observational analyses identify brain structures associated with BP, which may be responsible for the adverse effects of hypertension on cognitive performance.",

        "answer": "Healio: Yes, a healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, it is thought that a healthy diet and regular exercise may help to reduce the risk of cancer by:\n\n1. Reducing inflammation: A healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to reduce systemic inflammation, which is a known risk factor for cancer.\n2. Improving insulin sensitivity: Exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, which can help to reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as breast and colon cancer.\n3. Modulating the gut microbiome: A healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to modulate the gut microbiome, which can help to reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer.\n4. Reducing oxidative stress: A healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to reduce oxidative stress, which is a known risk factor for cancer.\n\nIt is important to note that while a healthy diet and regular exercise may help to reduce the risk of cancer, they are not a guarantee against developing the disease. Other factors, such as genetics, smoking, and exposure to carcinogens, can also play a role in the development of cancer. It is also important to note that the relationship between diet, exercise, and cancer is complex and multifactorial, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which a healthy diet and regular exercise may help to reduce the risk of cancer.",

The lack of clarity of some diet-cancer relationships reflects the ongoing debate about the relative contribution of genetic factors, environmental exposures, and replicative errors in stem cell division as determinate drivers of cancer risk. In addition, dietary guidance has often been based upon research assuming that the effects of diet and nutrition on carcinogenesis would be uniform across populations and for various tumor types arising in a specific organ, i.e., that one size fits all. Herein, we present a paradigm for investigating precision dietary patterns that leverages the approaches that led to successful small-molecule inhibitors in cancer treatment, namely understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small molecules for targeting carcinogenic mechanisms. We challenge the scientific community to refine the paradigm presented and to conduct proof-in-concept experiments that integrate existing knowledge (drug development, natural products, and the food metabolome) with developments in artificial intelligence to design and then test dietary patterns predicted to elicit drug-like effects on target tissues for cancer prevention and control. We refer to this precision approach as dietary oncopharmacognosy and envision it as the crosswalk between the currently defined fields of precision oncology and precision nutrition with the goal of reducing cancer deaths.",

Study purpose: To analyze public awareness of overweight/obesity as a risk factor for cancer and analyze public perceptions on the feasibility of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent, as an educational intervention tool. Methods: A mixed-methods approach including deductive quantitative cross-sectional approach to draw precise conclusions based on empirical evidence on public awareness of the link between obesity and cancer; and inductive qualitative approach to interpret public perceptions on using ChatGPT for creating awareness of obesity, cancer and its risk factors was used in this study. Participants included adult residents in Saudi Arabia. A total of 486 individuals and 21 individuals were included in the survey and semi-structured interviews respectively. Results: About 65% of the participants are not completely aware of cancer and its risk factors. Significant differences in awareness were observed concerning age groups (p < .0001), socio-economic status (p = .041), and regional distribution (p = .0351). A total of 10 themes were analyzed from the interview data, which included four positive factors (accessibility, personalization, cost-effectiveness, anonymity and privacy, multi-language support) and five negative factors (information inaccuracy, lack of emotional intelligence, dependency and overreliance, data privacy and security, and inability to provide physical support or diagnosis). Conclusion: This study has underscored the potential of leveraging ChatGPT as a valuable public awareness tool for cancer in Saudi Arabia.",

This review article aims to describe the influence of microbial dysbiosis on breast cancer occurrence and the possible interactions between oncobiome and specific breast cancer molecular subtypes. The review further also discusses the role of epigenetics and diet/nutrition in the regulation of the gut and breast microbiome and its association with breast cancer prevention, therapy, and recurrence. Additionally, the recent technological advances in microbiome research, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, genome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and microbial metabolomics along with recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have also been reviewed.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of parental cancer with IQ, stress resilience, and physical fitness of the affected men during early adulthood. Materials and methods: In this Swedish population-based study, we included 465,249 men born during 1973-1983 who underwent the military conscription examination around the age of 18 years. We identified cancer diagnoses among the parents of these men from the Cancer Register. IQ, stress resilience, and physical fitness of the men were assessed at the time of conscription and categorized into three levels: low, moderate, and high (reference category). We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the studied associations. Results: Overall, parental cancer was associated with higher risks of low stress resilience (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.15]) and low physical fitness (RRR: 1.12 [95% CI 1.05-1.19]). Stronger associations were observed for parental cancer with a poor expected prognosis (low stress resilience: RRR: 1.59 [95% CI 1.31-1.94]; low physical fitness: RRR: 1.45 [95% CI 1.14-1.85]) and for parental death after cancer diagnosis (low stress resilience: RRR: 1.29 [95% CI 1.16-1.43]; low physical fitness: RRR: 1.40 [95% CI 1.23-1.59]). Although there was no overall association between parental cancer and IQ, parental death after cancer diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of low IQ (RRR: 1.11 [95% CI 1.01-1.24]). Conclusion: Parental cancer, particularly severe and fatal type, is associated with higher risks of low stress resilience and low physical fitness among men during early adulthood.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of parental cancer with IQ, stress resilience, and physical fitness of the affected men during early adulthood. Materials and methods: In this Swedish population-based study, we included 465,249 men born during 1973-1983 who underwent the military conscription examination around the age of 18 years. We identified cancer diagnoses among the parents of these men from the Cancer Register. IQ, stress resilience, and physical fitness of the men were assessed at the time of conscription and categorized into three levels: low, moderate, and high (reference category). We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the studied associations. Results: Overall, parental cancer was associated with higher risks of low stress resilience (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.15]) and low physical fitness (RRR: 1.12 [95% CI 1.05-1.19]). Stronger associations were observed for parental cancer with a poor expected prognosis (low stress resilience: RRR: 1.59 [95% CI 1.31-1.94]; low physical fitness: RRR: 1.45 [95% CI 1.14-1.85]) and for parental death after cancer diagnosis (low stress resilience: RRR: 1.29 [95% CI 1.16-1.43]; low physical fitness: RRR: 1.40 [95% CI 1.23-1.59]). Although there was no overall association between parental cancer and IQ, parental death after cancer diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of low IQ (RRR: 1.11 [95% CI 1.01-1.24]). Conclusion: Parental cancer, particularly severe and fatal type, is associated with higher risks of low stress resilience and low physical fitness among men during early adulthood. Men who experienced parental death after cancer diagnosis also have a higher risk of low IQ.",

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that therapist-guided IMIS (Internet-based and Mobile-based Interventions) can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Additionally, paediatricians are more likely than ever to encounter patients with mental health problems on a daily basis, and there is a need for investment in proven treatments, such as psychology-based interventions, for children identified with mental health disorders. However, it is important to note that the effects of unguided IMIS are less clear, particularly under routine care conditions.\n\nMoreover, there are four main arguments supporting the engagement of psychologists for children with mental health problems, including the effectiveness of psychological interventions in treating a wide range of mental health disorders, the openness of many parents and children to exploring psychological therapies rather than medication, the ability of psychologists to perform psychoeducational assessments, and the potential to prevent or improve behaviour problems in children through parent-based interventions.\n\nIt is also important to consider the ethical considerations arising from the delicate balance of pharmacological therapies, highlighting the responsibility of administering drugs that significantly affect mental health. Cultural factors become a pillar, emphasizing the crucial role of cultural sensitivity in promoting tolerance.\n\nIn summary, medication can be a useful treatment option for mental health disorders, but it is important to consider the limitations and challenges of unguided IMIS and to invest in proven treatments, such as psychology-based interventions, for children identified with mental health disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",

The story develops by investigating historical viewpoints while reflecting on the present and highlighting the lessons learned and their impact on contemporary practices. We have advanced from the stigmatized constraints of asylums to a paradigm that puts human rights, dignity, and individualized, culturally sensitive treatment first. Modern methods are much more varied and evidence-based, from cutting-edge technical advancements to evidence-based psychotherapies. The ethical considerations arising from the delicate balance of pharmacological therapies underline the responsibility of administering drugs that significantly affect mental health. Cultural factors become a pillar, highlighting how crucial cultural sensitivity is to promoting tolerance. By acknowledging how many facets of the human experience are interrelated, holistic methods help close the gap between the mind and body. Integrative medicine and alternative therapies represent a shift away from reductionist approaches and toward a holistic viewpoint. The delivery of mental health treatment is being reimagined by technological advancements, with virtual and digital environments opening up new access and support channels. These developments cut beyond regional boundaries, reinventing conventional therapy dynamics and paving the way for individualized therapies. Cultural concerns highlight the significance of cultural competency in navigating the complex mental health treatment system and adapting interventions to fit the particular requirements of various cultural contexts. With telepsychiatry, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence among the new technologies that promise to further revolutionize mental health therapies, the essay looks to the future. This review concludes by imagining a day when mental health is prioritized, therapies are available, and the diversity of human experience is valued. The path to a society that values, nurtures, and celebrates mental health continues.",

Recent findings: There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia that can be treated with 7 days of therapy, community acquired pneumonia with 3 days and ventilator associated pneumonia with just 7 days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis and bone and joint infections is safe and effective and reduces line complications and costs. Also, for clean surgical procedures only one dose of antibiotic is needed, but it should be the most effective antibiotic which is cefazolin. This means avoiding clindamycin, removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence to incorporate into using antibiotics wisely is rapidly emerging but is still in early stages. Summary: In using antibiotics wisely, targeting such as durations of therapy and conversion from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low hanging fruit. The future of artificial intelligence could automate a lot of this work and is exciting but needs to be proven. Video abstract: http://links.lww.com/COID/A50.",

Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents.

However, recommendations regarding the duration of antibiotic therapy vary largely because of the absence of reliable data on the optimal CAP treatment according to the bacterial etiology of the disease, its severity, and child characteristics.

According to the PubMed abstracts, vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Additionally, researchers have been looking into vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer, and clinical trials have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. However, misconceptions about vaccines have emerged and increased due to a combination of factors, including the availability of information on the internet and the influence of celebrities and opinion leaders. It is important to improve communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases to regain lost confidence and address these misconceptions.",

                    "abstract": "Despite immunisation being one of the greatest medical success stories of the twentieth century, there is a growing lack of confidence in some vaccines. Improving communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases may help regain this lost confidence. A conference was organised at the Fondation Merieux in France to discuss what benefits could be communicated and how innovative digital initiatives can used for communication. During this meeting, a wide range of indirect benefits of vaccination were discussed. For example, influenza vaccination can reduce hospitalisations and deaths in older persons with diabetes by 45% and 38%, respectively, but the link between influenza and complications from underlying chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is frequently underestimated. Vaccination can reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is growing, by reducing the incidence of infectious disease (though direct and indirect or herd protection), by reducing the number of circulating AMR strains, and by reducing the need for antimicrobial use. Disease morbidity and treatment costs in the elderly population are likely to rise substantially, with the ageing global population. Healthy ageing and life-course vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Novel disease surveillance systems based on information from Internet search engines, mobile phone apps, social media, cloud-based electronic health records, and crowd-sourced systems, contribute to improved awareness of disease burden. Examples of the role of new techniques and tools to process data generated by multiple sources, such as artificial intelligence, to support vaccination programmes, such as influenza and dengue, were discussed. The conference participants agreed that continual efforts are needed from all stakeholders to ensure effective, transparent communication of the full benefits and risks of vaccination.",

                    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.",

Similar vaccine regimens have also not consistently protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) against viral acquisition. Conversely, experimental vaccines of different designs have protected macaques from viral challenges but then failed to protect humans, while many other HIV-1 vaccine candidates have not protected NHPs. While efficacy varies more in NHPs than humans, vaccines have failed to protect in the most stringent NHP model. Intense investigations have aimed to identify correlates of protection (CoPs), even in the absence of net protection. Unvaccinated animals and humans vary vastly in their susceptibility to infection and in their innate and adaptive responses to the vaccines; hence, merely statistical associations with factors that do not protect are easily found. Systems biological analyses, including artificial intelligence, have identified numerous candidate CoPs but with no clear consistency within or between species. Proposed CoPs sometimes have only tenuous mechanistic connections to immune protection. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are a central mechanistic CoP for vaccines that succeed against other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. No HIV-1 vaccine candidate has yet elicited potent and broadly active NAbs in NHPs or humans, but narrow-specificity NAbs against the HIV-1 isolate corresponding to the immunogen do protect against infection by the autologous virus. Here, we analyze why so many HIV-1 vaccines have failed, summarize the outcomes of vaccination in NHPs and humans, and discuss the value and pitfalls of hunting for CoPs other than NAbs. We contrast the failure to find a consistent CoP for HIV-1 vaccines with the identification of NAbs as the principal CoP for SARS-CoV-2.",

Improving communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases may help regain this lost confidence. A conference was organised at the Fondation Merieux in France to discuss what benefits could be communicated and how innovative digital initiatives can used for communication. During this meeting, a wide range of indirect benefits of vaccination were discussed. For example, influenza vaccination can reduce hospitalisations and deaths in older persons with diabetes by 45% and 38%, respectively, but the link between influenza and complications from underlying chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is frequently underestimated. Vaccination can reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is growing, by reducing the incidence of infectious disease (though direct and indirect or herd protection), by reducing the number of circulating AMR strains, and by reducing the need for antimicrobial use. Disease morbidity and treatment costs in the elderly population are likely to rise substantially, with the ageing global population. Healthy ageing and life-course vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Novel disease surveillance systems based on information from Internet search engines, mobile phone apps, social media, cloud-based electronic health records, and crowd-sourced systems, contribute to improved awareness of disease burden. Examples of the role of new techniques and tools to process data generated by multiple sources, such as artificial intelligence, to support vaccination programmes, such as influenza and dengue, were discussed. The conference participants agreed that continual efforts are needed from all stakeholders to ensure effective, transparent communication of the full benefits and risks of vaccination.",

                    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.",

Studies have shown that individuals with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes have lower verbal memory scores compared to those without diabetes, and this association persists even after controlling for other factors such as educational level. Additionally, the abstracts suggest that male sex and higher body mass index among individuals with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes are also associated with impaired verbal memory. It is important to note that these findings are based on cross-sectional studies and further research is needed to confirm these associations and establish causality.",

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis within the German Diabetes Study included patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes within the first year after diagnosis or five years after study inclusion and metabolically healthy individuals. Participants underwent comprehensive metabolic phenotyping and testing of different domains of cognitive function.

Results: In participants with recently diagnosed diabetes, verbal memory was poorer in patients with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.029), but not in type 1 diabetes (P = 0.156), when compared to healthy individuals. Five years after diagnosis, type 2 diabetes patients also showed lower verbal memory than those with type 1 diabetes (P = 0.012).

Objective: This study aimed to characterize the relationship between cognitive function and the risk for IFG among young adults. Design and setting: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing data collected at pre-military recruitment assessments with information collected at the screening center of Israeli Army Medical Corps. Participants: Normoglycemic adults (n = 17 348) (free of IFG and diabetes; mean age 31.0 \u00b1 5.6 y; 87% men) of the Metabolic Lifestyle and Nutrition Assessment in Young Adults (MELANY) cohort with data regarding their General Intelligence Score (GIS), a comprehensive measure of cognitive function, at age 17 y. Interventions: Fasting plasma glucose was assessed every 3-5 y at scheduled visits. Cox proportional hazards models were applied. Main outcomes measures: The main outcome of the study was incident IFG (\u2265 100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL) at scheduled visits. Results: During a median followup of 6.6 y, 1478 cases of IFG were recorded (1402 men). After adjustment for age and sex, participants in the lowest GIS category had a 1.9-fold greater risk for incident IFG compared with those in the highest GIS category. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, family history of diabetes, country of origin, socioeconomic status, education, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, breakfast consumption, triglyceride level, white blood cell count, the risk for IFG was nearly doubled in the lowest GIS category compared with the highest GIS category (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.3; P < .001). These results persisted when GIS was treated as a continuous variable and when the model was adjusted also for body mass index at the end of followup. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that lower cognitive function at late adolescence is independently associated with an elevated risk IFG in both men and women.",

The findings of the CBmeter study will clarify the role of the CBs in the genesis of-metabolic diseases and guide the development of new therapeutic approaches for early intervention in metabolic disturbances. Results may also contribute to patient classification and stratification for future CB modulatory interventions. Methods: This is a non-randomised, multicentric, controlled clinical study. Forty participants (20 control and 20 diabetics) will be recruited from secondary and primary healthcare settings. The primary objective is to establish a new model of early diagnosis of metabolic diseases based on the respiratory and metabolic responses to transient 100% oxygen administration and ingestion of a standardised mixed meal. Analysis: Raw data acquired with the CBmeter will be endorsed against gold standard techniques for heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and interstitial glucose quantification and analysed a multivariate analysis software developed specifically for the CBmeter study (CBview). Data will be analysed using clustering analysis and artificial intelligence methods based on unsupervised learning algorithms, to establish the predictive value of diabetes diagnosis.

Methods: This study was performed in 228 people with Type 2 diabetes participating in the Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study. We examined the cross-sectional associations of score on the vocabulary test of the Groningen Intelligence Test with: 1) determinants of diabetic complications (HbA1c , blood pressure and lipid level); 2) diabetic complications: chronic kidney disease, neuropathic pain, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and carotid intima-media thickness; and 3) walking speed. Analyses were performed using linear regression and adjusted in separate models for potential confounders and mediators. Significant age- and sex-adjusted associations were additionally adjusted for educational level in a separate model. Results: After full adjustment, lower verbal intelligence was associated with the presence of neuropathic pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% CI 1.02;1.36], cardiovascular disease (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01;1.30), and slower walking speed (regression coefficient -0.011 m/s, 95% CI -0.021; -0.002 m/s). These associations were largely explained by education. Verbal intelligence was not associated with blood pressure, glycaemic control, lipid control, chronic kidney disease or carotid intima-media thickness. Conclusions: Lower verbal intelligence was associated with the presence of some diabetic complications and with a slower walking speed, a measure of physical functioning. Educational level largely explained these associations. This implies that clinicians should be aware of the educational level of people with diabetes and should provide information at a level of complexity tailored to the patient.",

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis within the German Diabetes Study included patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes within the first year after diagnosis or five years after study inclusion and metabolically healthy individuals. Participants underwent comprehensive metabolic phenotyping and testing of different domains of cognitive function. Linear regression models were used to compare cognition test outcomes and to test associations between cognitive function and possible influencing factors within the groups. Results: In participants with recently diagnosed diabetes, verbal memory was poorer in patients with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.029), but not in type 1 diabetes (P = 0.156), when compared to healthy individuals. Five years after diagnosis, type 2 diabetes patients also showed lower verbal memory than those with type 1 diabetes (P = 0.012).

Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, can help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiotoxicity in cancer survivors and people living with cancer (PLWC). The study found that aerobic exercise can also prevent relapses, CVd, and cardiotoxicity. Additionally, the study showed that resistance training can also have mutually beneficial effects on aerobic exercise.\n\nIt is important to note that the benefits of exercise for heart health are not limited to aerobic exercise. Resistance training, which involves using weights or resistance bands to build muscle strength, can also have a positive impact on heart health. A study published in the Journal of Cardio-Oncology found that resistance training can help improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors.\n\nOverall, it is important to incorporate both aerobic and resistance training into your exercise routine to maximize the benefits for heart health. It is also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.",

Therefore, it is beneficial to recommend exercise as part of cardio-oncology preventive care. Objective: With the progress of deep learning algorithms and the improvement of big data processing techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become popular in the fields of medicine and healthcare. In the context of the shortage of medical resources in China, it is of great significance to adopt AI and machine learning methods for prescription recommendations. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based intelligent system of exercise prescription for cardio-oncology preventive care, and this paper presents the study protocol. Methods: This will be a retrospective machine learning modeling cohort study with interventional methods (i.e., exercise prescription). We will recruit PLWC participants at baseline (from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2026) and follow up over several years (from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2028). Specifically, participants will be eligible if they are (1) PLWC in Stage I or cancer survivors from Stage I; (2) aged between 18 and 55 years; (3) interested in physical exercise for rehabilitation; (4) willing to wear smart sensors/watches; (5) assessed by doctors as suitable for exercise interventions. At baseline, clinical exercise physiologist certificated by the joint training program (from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024) of American College of Sports Medicine and Chinese Association of Sports Medicine will recommend exercise prescription to each participant. During the follow-up, effective exercise prescription will be determined by assessing the CVD status of the participants. Expected outcomes: This study aims to develop not only an interpretable machine learning model to recommend exercise prescription but also an intelligent system of exercise prescription for precision cardio-oncology preventive care. Ethics: This study is approved by Human Experimental Ethics Inspection of Guangzhou Sport University. Clinical trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2300077887.",

Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

They are also among the top three causes in almost 180 countries worldwide. Cardiovascular complications are often noticed in cancer patients, with nearly 20% exhibiting cardiovascular comorbidities. Physical exercise may be helpful for cancer survivors and people living with cancer (PLWC), as it prevents relapses, CVD, and cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is beneficial to recommend exercise as part of cardio-oncology preventive care. Objective: With the progress of deep learning algorithms and the improvement of big data processing techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become popular in the fields of medicine and healthcare. In the context of the shortage of medical resources in China, it is of great significance to adopt AI and machine learning methods for prescription recommendations. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based intelligent system of exercise prescription for cardio-oncology preventive care, and this paper presents the study protocol. Methods: This will be a retrospective machine learning modeling cohort study with interventional methods (i.e., exercise prescription). We will recruit PLWC participants at baseline (from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2026) and follow up over several years (from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2028). Specifically, participants will be eligible if they are (1) PLWC in Stage I or cancer survivors from Stage I; (2) aged between 18 and 55 years; (3) interested in physical exercise for rehabilitation; (4) willing to wear smart sensors/watches; (5) assessed by doctors as suitable for exercise interventions. At baseline, clinical exercise physiologist certificated by the joint training program (from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024) of American College of Sports Medicine and Chinese Association of Sports Medicine will recommend exercise prescription to each participant. During the follow-up, effective exercise prescription will be determined by assessing the CVD status of the participants.

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

Methods: We derived an algorithm, Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), using the HUNT Fitness Study (n = 4631), and validated it in the general HUNT population (n = 39,298) aged 20-74 years. The PAI was divided into three sex-specific groups (\u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100), and the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the referent. Hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regressions. Results: After >1 million person-years of observations during a mean follow-up time of 26.2 (SD 5.9) years, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 women) from cardiovascular disease. Men and women with a PAI level \u2265100 had 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-27%) and 23% (95% CI, 4%-38%) reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively, compared with the inactive groups. Obtaining \u2265100 PAI was associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease mortality in all prespecified age groups, and in participants with known cardiovascular disease risk factors (all P-trends <.01). Participants who did not obtain \u2265100 PAI had increased risk of dying regardless of meeting the physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: PAI may have a huge potential to motivate people to become and stay physically active, as it is an easily understandable and scientifically proven metric that could inform potential users of how much physical activity is needed to reduce the risk of premature cardiovascular disease death.",

        "answer": "Healio: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that can cause recurring episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Seeking medical help for asthma is crucial to manage the condition effectively and prevent severe attacks. Here are some instances when you should seek medical help for asthma:\n\n1. Severe asthma symptoms: If you experience severe asthma symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, or intense coughing, you should seek medical help immediately. These symptoms can be life-threatening and require immediate attention.\n2. Frequent asthma attacks: If you have frequent asthma attacks, especially if they occur more than twice a week, you should consult with your healthcare provider. They can help you identify triggers and develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms.\n3. Worsening symptoms: If your asthma symptoms worsen despite treatment, you should seek medical help. This can indicate that your condition is not well-controlled, and you may need to adjust your treatment plan.\n4. New symptoms: If you experience new symptoms, such as chest pain, fever, or difficulty speaking, you should seek medical help immediately. These symptoms can be signs of a severe asthma attack or other respiratory conditions, and prompt medical attention is essential.\n5. Difficulty managing symptoms: If you find it challenging to manage your asthma symptoms despite following your treatment plan, you should consult with your healthcare provider.

Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods: This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (<18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements: Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results: Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374-1.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2-5), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3-15); p<0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82-1.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians' burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.",

Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82-1.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians' burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.",

Experts have recommended the use of digital innovations to help address the issues of poor outcomes and lack of care access. An automated SMS text messaging-based conversational agent (ie, chatbot) created to provide access to asthma support in a familiar format via a mobile phone has the potential to help people with asthma across demographics and at scale. Such a chatbot could help improve the accuracy of self-assessed risk, improve asthma self-management, increase access to professional care, and ultimately reduce asthma attacks and emergencies. Objective: The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and usability of a text-based conversational agent that processes a patient's text responses and short sample voice recordings to calculate an estimate of their risk for an asthma exacerbation and then offers follow-up information for lowering risk and improving asthma control; assess the levels of engagement for different groups of users, particularly those who do not access professional services and those with poor asthma control; and assess the extent to which users of the chatbot perceive it as helpful for improving their understanding and self-management of their condition. Methods: We will recruit 300 adults through four channels for broad reach: Facebook, YouGov, Asthma + Lung UK social media, and the website Healthily (a health self-management app). Participants will be screened, and those who meet inclusion criteria (adults diagnosed with asthma and who use WhatsApp) will be provided with a link to access the conversational agent through WhatsApp on their mobile phones. Participants will be sent scheduled and randomly timed messages to invite them to engage in dialogue about their asthma risk during the period of study. After a data collection period (28 days), participants will respond to questionnaire items related to the quality of the interaction. A pre- and postquestionnaire will measure asthma control before and after the intervention. Results: This study was funded in March 2021 and started in January 2022. We developed a prototype conversational agent, which was iteratively improved with feedback from people with asthma, asthma nurses, and specialist doctors. Fortnightly reviews of iterations by the clinical team began in September 2022 and are ongoing. This feasibility study will start recruitment in January 2023. The anticipated completion of the study is July 2023. A future randomized controlled trial will depend on the outcomes of this study and funding. Conclusions: This feasibility study will inform a follow-up pilot and larger randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a conversational agent on asthma outcomes, self-management, behavior change, and access to care.

Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods: This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (<18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements: Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results: Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374-1.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2-5), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3-15); p<0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82-1.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians' burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.",

We collected information about each app using the app stores and publicly available manufacturer websites. We reported the results descriptively. Results: We identified 6 apps, released as early as 2012. Of these, 5 apps require an external sensor available over the counter to be attached to the patient's inhaler, and 1 app communicates with a prescription-only inhaler that has a built-in sensor and will be dispensed from the pharmacy. Aside from passively monitoring inhaler adherence, all apps facilitate provider communication; serve as a diary; and use notifications, reminders, or alarms for things such as inhaler dose reminders. Additional features vary across apps, including direct pharmacy access for refill requests and telehealth and artificial intelligence to predict future asthma exacerbations. Conclusion: We identified 6 consumer-directed mHealth apps that communicate with inhalers for asthma management. Pharmacists must be prepared to evaluate these apps, particularly in comparison with the first prescription-only inhaler built to communicate with an mHealth app to be released this year. To do so, further research on the outcomes and use of these apps is needed so that pharmacists can make evidence-based recommendations.",

Experts have recommended the use of digital innovations to help address the issues of poor outcomes and lack of care access. An automated SMS text messaging-based conversational agent (ie, chatbot) created to provide access to asthma support in a familiar format via a mobile phone has the potential to help people with asthma across demographics and at scale. Such a chatbot could help improve the accuracy of self-assessed risk, improve asthma self-management, increase access to professional care, and ultimately reduce asthma attacks and emergencies. Objective: The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and usability of a text-based conversational agent that processes a patient's text responses and short sample voice recordings to calculate an estimate of their risk for an asthma exacerbation and then offers follow-up information for lowering risk and improving asthma control; assess the levels of engagement for different groups of users, particularly those who do not access professional services and those with poor asthma control; and assess the extent to which users of the chatbot perceive it as helpful for improving their understanding and self-management of their condition. Methods: We will recruit 300 adults through four channels for broad reach: Facebook, YouGov, Asthma + Lung UK social media, and the website Healthily (a health self-management app). Participants will be screened, and those who meet inclusion criteria (adults diagnosed with asthma and who use WhatsApp) will be provided with a link to access the conversational agent through WhatsApp on their mobile phones. Participants will be sent scheduled and randomly timed messages to invite them to engage in dialogue about their asthma risk during the period of study. After a data collection period (28 days), participants will respond to questionnaire items related to the quality of the interaction. A pre- and postquestionnaire will measure asthma control before and after the intervention. Results: This study was funded in March 2021 and started in January 2022. We developed a prototype conversational agent, which was iteratively improved with feedback from people with asthma, asthma nurses, and specialist doctors. Fortnightly reviews of iterations by the clinical team began in September 2022 and are ongoing. This feasibility study will start recruitment in January 2023. The anticipated completion of the study is July 2023. A future randomized controlled trial will depend on the outcomes of this study and funding. Conclusions: This feasibility study will inform a follow-up pilot and larger randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a conversational agent on asthma outcomes, self-management, behavior change, and access to care.

        "answer": "Healio: The risk of developing lung cancer can vary depending on several factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures. Our study found that certain genetic variants, such as those related to dietary behaviors, fitness metrics, educational attainment, and other psychosocial traits, were significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Additionally, we found that the body mass index (BMI) was positively correlated with lung cancer risk, suggesting that being overweight or obese may increase the likelihood of developing lung cancer. However, it is important to note that these findings are based on a prospective study of individuals at intermediate to high risk of developing lung cancer, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and identify additional risk factors.

                    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and in China. Screening for lung cancer by low dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce mortality but has resulted in a dramatic rise in the incidence of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, which presents a major diagnostic challenge for clinicians regarding their underlying pathology and can lead to overdiagnosis. To address the significant gap in evaluating pulmonary nodules, we conducted a prospective study to develop a prediction model for individuals at intermediate to high risk of developing lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were applied to the training cohort (n = 560) to develop an early lung cancer prediction model. The results indicated that a model integrating clinical characteristics (age and smoking history), radiological characteristics of pulmonary nodules (nodule diameter, nodule count, upper lobe location, malignant sign at the nodule edge, subsolid status), artificial intelligence analysis of LDCT data, and liquid biopsy achieved the best diagnostic performance in the training cohort (sensitivity 89.53%, specificity 81.31%, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.880). In the independent validation cohort (n = 168), this model had an AUC of 0.895, which was greater than that of the Mayo Clinic Model (AUC = 0.772) and Veterans' Affairs Model (AUC = 0.740). These results were significantly better for predicting the presence of cancer than radiological features and artificial intelligence risk scores alone. Applying this classifier prospectively may lead to improved early lung cancer diagnosis and early treatment for patients with malignant nodules while sparing patients with benign entities from unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery.

Screening for lung cancer by low dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce mortality but has resulted in a dramatic rise in the incidence of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, which presents a major diagnostic challenge for clinicians regarding their underlying pathology and can lead to overdiagnosis. To address the significant gap in evaluating pulmonary nodules, we conducted a prospective study to develop a prediction model for individuals at intermediate to high risk of developing lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were applied to the training cohort (n = 560) to develop an early lung cancer prediction model. The results indicated that a model integrating clinical characteristics (age and smoking history), radiological characteristics of pulmonary nodules (nodule diameter, nodule count, upper lobe location, malignant sign at the nodule edge, subsolid status), artificial intelligence analysis of LDCT data, and liquid biopsy achieved the best diagnostic performance in the training cohort (sensitivity 89.53%, specificity 81.31%, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.880). In the independent validation cohort (n = 168), this model had an AUC of 0.895, which was greater than that of the Mayo Clinic Model (AUC = 0.772) and Veterans' Affairs Model (AUC = 0.740). These results were significantly better for predicting the presence of cancer than radiological features and artificial intelligence risk scores alone. Applying this classifier prospectively may lead to improved early lung cancer diagnosis and early treatment for patients with malignant nodules while sparing patients with benign entities from unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery.

                    "abstract": "Background: Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension are major global health challenges. Healthy eating can help people with chronic diseases manage their condition and prevent complications. However, making healthy meal plans is not easy, as it requires the consideration of various factors such as health concerns, nutritional requirements, tastes, economic status, and time limits. Therefore, there is a need for effective, affordable, and personalized meal planning that can assist people in choosing food that suits their individual needs and preferences. Objective: This study aimed to design an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered meal planner that can generate personalized healthy meal plans based on the user's specific health conditions, personal preferences, and status. Methods: We proposed a system that integrates semantic reasoning, fuzzy logic, heuristic search, and multicriteria analysis to produce flexible, optimized meal plans based on the user's health concerns, nutrition needs, as well as food restrictions or constraints, along with other personal preferences. Specifically, we constructed an ontology-based knowledge base to model knowledge about food and nutrition. We defined semantic rules to represent dietary guidelines for different health concerns and built a fuzzy membership of food nutrition based on the experience of experts to handle vague and uncertain nutritional data. We applied a semantic rule-based filtering mechanism to filter out food that violate mandatory health guidelines and constraints, such as allergies and religion. We designed a novel, heuristic search method that identifies the best meals among several candidates and evaluates them based on their fuzzy nutritional score. To select nutritious meals that also satisfy the user's other preferences, we proposed a multicriteria decision-making approach. Results: We implemented a mobile app prototype system and evaluated its effectiveness through a use case study and user study. The results showed that the system generated healthy and personalized meal plans that considered the user's health concerns, optimized nutrition values, respected dietary restrictions and constraints, and met the user's preferences. The users were generally satisfied with the system and its features. Conclusions: We designed an AI-powered meal planner that helps people create healthy and personalized meal plans based on their health conditions, preferences, and status. Our system uses multiple techniques to create optimized meal plans that consider multiple factors that affect food choice. Our evaluation tests confirmed the usability and feasibility of the proposed system. However, some limitations such as the lack of dynamic and real-time updates should be addressed in future studies. This study contributes to the development of AI-powered personalized meal planning systems that can support people's health and nutrition goals.",

The objective of this work was to characterize the \"healthfulness\" of foods in Canadian LTC and inflammatory potential of the LTC diet and how this varied by key covariates. Here, we define foods to have higher \"healthfulness\" if the are in accordance with the evidence-based 2019 Canada's Food Guide, or with comparatively lower inflammatory potential. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Making the Most of Mealtimes dataset (32 LTC homes; four provinces). A novel computational algorithm categorized food items from 3-day weighed food records into 68 expert-informed categories and Canada's Food Guide (CFG) food groups. The dietary inflammatory potential of these food sources was assessed using the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Comparisons were made by sex, diet texture, and nutritional status. Results: Consumption patterns using expert-informed categories indicated no single protein or vegetable source was among the top 5 most commonly consumed foods. In terms of CFG's groups, protein food sources (i.e., foods with a high protein content) represented the highest proportion of daily calorie intake (33.4%; animal-based: 31.6%, plant-based: 1.8%), followed by other foods (31.3%) including juice (9.8%), grains (25.0%; refined: 15.0%, whole: 10.0%), and vegetables/fruits (10.3%; plain: 4.9%, with additions: 5.4%). The overall DII score (mean, IQR) was positive (0.93, 0.23 to 1.75) indicating foods consumed tend towards a pro-inflammatory response. DII was significantly associated with sex (female higher; p<0.0001), and diet (minced higher; p=0.036). Conclusions: \"Healthfulness\" of Canadian LTC menus may be enhanced by lowering inflammatory potential to support chronic disease management through further shifts from refined to whole grains, incorporating more plant-based proteins, and moving towards serving plain vegetables and fruits. However, there are multiple layers of complexities to consider when optimising foods aligned with the CFG, and shifting to foods with anti-inflammatory potential for enhanced health benefits, while balancing nutrition and ensuring sufficient food and fluid intake to prevent or treat malnutrition.",

One of the main effects is increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. Hypertension can also cause damage to blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis, kidney disease, and vision loss. Additionally, high blood pressure can increase the risk of peripheral artery disease, which can lead to leg pain and mobility issues. Furthermore, hypertension can also increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

Methods: Using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the independent effects of education, intelligence, or cognition on hypertension (FinnGen study, 70 651 cases/223 663 controls; UK Biobank, 77 723 cases/330 366 controls) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure, 757 601 participants), and used 2-step Mendelian randomization to evaluate 25 potential mediators of the association and calculate the mediated proportions. Results: Meta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings illustrated the causal, independent impact of education on hypertension and blood pressure and outlined cardiometabolic mediators as priority targets for prevention of hypertension attributable to low education.",

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: This study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had completed an intelligence test at age 11 years. Participants: 1091 members of the LBC1936 with assessments of cognitive ability in childhood and older adulthood, and blood pressure measurements in older adulthood. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Participants were followed up at ages 70, 73, 76 and 79, and latent growth curve models and linear mixed models were used to analyse both cognitive functions and blood pressure as primary outcomes. Results: Blood pressure followed a quadratic trajectory in the eighth decade: on average blood pressure rose in the first waves and subsequently fell. Intercepts and trajectories were not associated between blood pressure and cognitive functions. Women with higher early-life cognitive function generally had lower blood pressure during the eighth decade. Being prescribed antihypertensive medication was associated with lower blood pressure, but not with better cognitive function. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that women with higher early-life cognitive function had lower later-life blood pressure. However, we did not find support for the hypothesis that rises in blood pressure and worse cognitive decline are associated with one another in the eighth decade.",

Insufficient blood supply will cause tissue hypoxia, provoke cellular oxidative stress, and to some extent lead to organ injury. Perioperative BP is labile and dynamic, and intraoperative hypotension is common. It is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between intraoperative hypotension and organ injury. However, hypotension surely compromises perfusion and causes harm to some extent. Because the harm threshold remains unknown, various guidelines for intraoperative BP management have been proposed. With the pending definitions from robust randomized trials, it is reasonable to consider observational analyses suggesting that mean arterial pressures below 65 mmHg sustained for more than 15 minutes are associated with myocardial and renal injury. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may facilitate the management of hemodynamics globally, including fluid administration, rather than BP alone. The previous mounting studies concentrated on associations between BP targets and adverse complications, whereas few studies were concerned about how to treat and multiple factors for decision-making. Hence, in this narrative review, we discussed the way of BP measurement and current knowledge about baseline BP extracting for surgical patients, highlighted the decision-making process for BP management with a view to providing pragmatic guidance for BP treatment in the clinical settings, and evaluated the merits of an automated blood control system in predicting hypotension.",

It is therefore important to document the independent influence of motivation apart from engagement on markers of cardiovascular autonomic modulation, including vasomotor tone (low-frequency systolic blood pressure, LFSBP), blood pressure homeostasis (baroreflex sensitivity, BRS), and myocardial oxygen consumption (rate pressure product, RPP). Accordingly, an arithmetic task (AT) was used to manipulate motivation to evaluate its impact on cardiovascular reactivity. Forty-two young adults (Mage = 20.21 years, SD = 2.09) qualified for the study. After a 10-min resting period, electrocardiogram and finger beat-to-beat blood pressure were recorded at three distinct 5-min stages: baseline (BASE), AT, and recovery (REC). Prior to AT initiation, participants were randomized into two groups based on directions stating that the AT task was either designed to be entertaining and fun (low MP, LMP) or a test diagnostic of one's intelligence (high MP, HMP). Independent of task engagement ratings, motivation to complete the AT task as well as solution success was significantly greater in the HMP than the LMP condition. Regarding physiological parameters, two (LMP vs. HMP) \u00d7 three (BASE, AT, REC) repeated measures ANOVAs revealed no significant baseline differences but a significant higher order interaction indicating that in comparison to LMP, individuals in the HMP condition had significantly higher vasomotor tone and myocardial oxygen consumption but not BRS.

                    "abstract": "Currently about 160 population-based cancer registries (CRs) in Europe have extensive experience in generating valid information on variation in cancer risk and survival with time and place. Most CRs cover all cancers, but some are confined to specific cancers or to children. They cover 15-55% of the populations in all of the larger member states of the European Union (EU), except the United Kingdom (UK), and 100% coverage in 80% of those with populations below 20 million. The EU FP 7 EUROCOURSE project, which operated in 2009-2013, explored the essential role of CRs in cancer research and public health, and also focused attention on their programme owners (POs) and stakeholders (e.g. cancer societies, oncological professionals, cancer patient groups, and planners, providers and evaluators of cancer care and mass screening). Generally, all CRs depended on their regional and/or national oncological context and were increasingly involved in population-based studies of quality of cancer care, long-term prognosis and quality of life, one third being very active. Within the public health domain, CRs, in addition to describing the variety of environmental and lifestyle-related cancer epidemics, have also contributed actively to aetiologic research by a European databases that showed wide discrepancies in cancer risk and survival across the EU, and in more depth by follow-up of cohorts and recruitment for case-control studies. CRs were also actively contributing to independent evaluation of mass screening as an intervention which affects quality of care and cancer mortality. The potential of CRs for clinical evaluation has grown substantially through interaction with clinical stakeholders and more incidentally biobanks, also with greater involvement of patient groups - with a special focus on elderly patients who generally do not take part in clinical trials. Whereas 25-35% of CRs are active in a range of cancer research areas, the rest have a low profile and usually provide only incidence and survival data. If they are unable to do so because POs and stakeholders do not demand it, they might also be inhibited by data protection restrictions, especially in German and French speaking countries. The value of population-based studies of quality of oncologic care and mass screening and the flawless reputation with regard to data protection of intensively used CRs in the northwest of Europe offered a sharp contrast, although they also follow the 1995 EU guideline on data protection. CRs thus offer a perfect example of what can be done with sensitive and minimal data, also when enriched by linkages to other databases. Intensive use of the data has allowed CR research departments to take on a visible expertise-based profile but a neutral in many public controversies in preventive oncology. Their management and fundability also appeared to benefit from externally classifying the wide array of tumour- or tract-specific intelligence and research activities for the various users in oncology and public health and also patients - who are the source of the data - are better informed. Transparency on what CRs enable may also improve through programmes of research have been deemed essential to our funding POs (ministries, cancer charities, cancer centres or public health institutes) who might benefit from some guidance to - often suboptimal -governance. Therefore, a metaphoric RegisTree has been developed for self-assessment and to clarify CR working methods and domain-specific performance to stakeholders and funding agencies, showing much room for development in many CRs. All in all, CRs are likely to remain unique sources of independent expert information on the burden of cancer, indispensable for cancer surveillance, with increased attention to cancer survivors, up to 4% of the population. Investments in the expanding CR network across Europe offer an excellent way forward for comparative future cancer surveillance with so many epidemiologic and clinical changes ahead.",

                    "abstract": "Background: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among cancer patients is widespread and mostly self-administrated. Today, one of the most relevant topics is the nondisclosure of CAM use to doctors. This general lack of communication exposes patients to dangerous behaviors and to less reliable information channels, such as the Web. The Italian context scarcely differs from this trend. Today, we are able to mine and analyze systematically the unstructured information available in the Web, to get an insight of people's opinions, beliefs, and rumors concerning health topics. Objective: Our aim was to analyze Italian Web conversations about CAM, identifying the most relevant Web sources, therapies, and diseases and measure the related sentiment. Methods: Data have been collected using the Web Intelligence tool ifMONITOR. The workflow consisted of 6 phases: (1) eligibility criteria definition for the ifMONITOR search profile; (2) creation of a CAM terminology database; (3) generic Web search and automatic filtering, the results have been manually revised to refine the search profile, and stored in the ifMONITOR database; (4) automatic classification using the CAM database terms; (5) selection of the final sample and manual sentiment analysis using a 1-5 score range; (6) manual indexing of the Web sources and CAM therapies type retrieved. Descriptive univariate statistics were computed for each item: absolute frequency, percentage, central tendency (mean sentiment score [MSS]), and variability (standard variation \u03c3). Results: Overall, 212 Web sources, 423 Web documents, and 868 opinions have been retrieved. The overall sentiment measured tends to a good score (3.6 of 5). Quite a high polarization in the opinions of the conversation partaking emerged from standard variation analysis (\u03c3\u22651). In total, 126 of 212 (59.4%) Web sources retrieved were nonhealth-related. Facebook (89; 21%) and Yahoo Answers (41; 9.7%) were the most relevant. In total, 94 CAM therapies have been retrieved. Most belong to the \"biologically based therapies or nutrition\" category: 339 of 868 opinions (39.1%), showing an MSS of 3.9 (\u03c3=0.83). Within nutrition, \"diets\" collected 154 opinions (18.4%) with an MSS of 3.8 (\u03c3=0.87); \"food as CAM\" overall collected 112 opinions (12.8%) with a MSS of 4 (\u03c3=0.68). Excluding diets and food, the most discussed CAM therapy is the controversial Italian \"Di Bella multitherapy\" with 102 opinions (11.8%) with an MSS of 3.4 (\u03c3=1.21). Breast cancer was the most mentioned disease: 81 opinions of 868. Conclusions: Conversations about CAM and cancer are ubiquitous. There is a great concern about the biologically based therapies, perceived as harmless and useful, under-rating all risks related to dangerous interactions or malnutrition. Our results can be useful to doctors to be aware of the implications of these beliefs for the clinical practice. Web conversation exploitation could be a strategy to gain insights of people's perspective for other controversial topics.",

Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

Methods: This paper aims to provide potential ICD-11 users with a profound understanding of the neoplasm classifications of the ICD-11 by analysing the differences and relationships between the ICD-11 and ICD-O in terms of the coding framework, compatibility and intelligence level. Results: The ICD-11 and ICD-O have remarkable differences in coding structure. Compared to the ICD-O, the ICD-11 has the following advantages: adding histopathology to the stem codes, obtaining a meaningful minimum amount of information through stem codes for statistics, supporting the usage of ICD-O morphology categories and capturing clinical details via extension codes for multiaxial coding. In addition, the rich Foundation Component, linearization derived from the Foundation Component and updating mechanism all support the compatibility of the ICD-11 with other classification systems. Notably, the WHO provides terminology coding with a smart coding tool, and coding in the ICD-11 can draw on statistical codes and uniform resource identifiers (URIs) simultaneously. Conclusions: The ICD-11 represents a novel classification system with distinguishing features that include facilitating statistics, multiaxial coding, coding granularity, compatibility and intelligence. These features enable the ICD-11 to be more powerful for neoplasm coding than the ICD-O and basically meet the needs of stakeholders.",

Methods: This paper aims to provide potential ICD-11 users with a profound understanding of the neoplasm classifications of the ICD-11 by analysing the differences and relationships between the ICD-11 and ICD-O in terms of the coding framework, compatibility and intelligence level. Results: The ICD-11 and ICD-O have remarkable differences in coding structure. Compared to the ICD-O, the ICD-11 has the following advantages: adding histopathology to the stem codes, obtaining a meaningful minimum amount of information through stem codes for statistics, supporting the usage of ICD-O morphology categories and capturing clinical details via extension codes for multiaxial coding. In addition, the rich Foundation Component, linearization derived from the Foundation Component and updating mechanism all support the compatibility of the ICD-11 with other classification systems. Notably, the WHO provides terminology coding with a smart coding tool, and coding in the ICD-11 can draw on statistical codes and uniform resource identifiers (URIs) simultaneously. Conclusions: The ICD-11 represents a novel classification system with distinguishing features that include facilitating statistics, multiaxial coding, coding granularity, compatibility and intelligence. These features enable the ICD-11 to be more powerful for neoplasm coding than the ICD-O and basically meet the needs of stakeholders.",

Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

        "answer": "Healio: The decision to start taking medication for mental health disorders can vary depending on the individual and the specific disorder. In general, medication is often prescribed when symptoms become severe or persistent, interfering with daily life, and other treatments such as therapy have not been effective. It is important to consult a mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment. They can help determine the best course of treatment, including medication, and monitor progress. Additionally, it is important to note that medication is not a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution, and it may take some trial and error to find the right medication and dosage that works best for an individual.

Very little information is available about the particular medications that are being prescribed by community mental health services and how this has changed over time. We set out to obtain details of psychiatric medications being prescribed by one Irish community mental health service. Method: All prescribing by the Cluain Mhuire Community Mental Health Service became electronic during 2004. Using Business Intelligence software, we obtained details of all psychiatric medications prescribed from 2005 to 2016. We compared numbers of prescriptions written in the first 6 years (2005-2010) with the following 6 (2011-2016). Results: Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed medication throughout but its use declined by one-quarter over the study period. Clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol prescribing increased. Prescriptions for mood stabilisers and antidepressants fell by 25%. Sedative prescriptions declined by almost 50%. Absolute numbers of prescriptions written for methylphenidate and pregabalin were small but increased dramatically over the time period. Conclusions: This community mental health service prescribed less of most psychiatric medications in 2016, than had been the case in 2005. This is despite an increase in the numbers of patients seen over the same period. It is not clear if this pattern is echoed in other services.",

Patients with device-based HF therapies have added risk for psychological disorders, with consequences for their physiological functioning, including adverse cardiac outcomes. Objectives: This study used natural language processing (NLP) for computer-assisted chart review to assess documentation of mental health and substance use in HF patients awaiting cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), a device-based HF therapy. Methods: We applied NLP to clinical notes from electronic health records (EHR) of 965 consecutive patients, with 9821 total clinical notes, at two academic medical centers between 2004 and 2015. We developed and validated a keyword library capturing terms related to mental health and substance use, while balancing specificity and sensitivity. Results: Mean age was 71.6 years (SD = 11.8), 78% male, and 87% non-Hispanic White. Of the 544 patients (56.4%) with documentation of mental health history, 9.7% had their mental health assessed and 6.6% had a plan documented. Of the 773 patients (80.1%) with documentation of substance use history, 10 (1.0%) had an assessment, and 3 (0.3%) had a plan. Conclusion: Despite clinical recommendations and standards of care, clinicians are under documenting assessments and plans prior to CRT. Future research should develop an algorithm to prompt clinicians to document this content. Such quality improvement efforts may ensure adherence to standards of care and clinical guidelines.",

Results: Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed medication throughout but its use declined by one-quarter over the study period. Clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol prescribing increased. Prescriptions for mood stabilisers and antidepressants fell by 25%. Sedative prescriptions declined by almost 50%. Absolute numbers of prescriptions written for methylphenidate and pregabalin were small but increased dramatically over the time period. Conclusions: This community mental health service prescribed less of most psychiatric medications in 2016, than had been the case in 2005. This is despite an increase in the numbers of patients seen over the same period. It is not clear if this pattern is echoed in other services.",

Some evidence suggests that psychiatric medications are systemically under-reported. Modern record linkage enables validation of self-report with national prescribing data as gold standard. Here, we investigated the validity of medication self-report for multiple medication types. Study design and setting: Participants in the Generation Scotland population-based cohort (N = 10,244) recruited 2009-2011 self-reported regular usage of several commonly prescribed medication classes. This was matched against Scottish NHS prescriptions data using 3- and 6-month fixed time windows. Potential predictors of discordant self-report, including general intelligence and psychological distress, were studied via multivariable logistic regression. Results: Antidepressants self-report showed very good agreement (\u03ba = 0.85, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-0.87]), comparable to antihypertensives (\u03ba = 0.90 [CI 0.89-0.91]). Self-report of mood stabilizers showed moderate-poor agreement (\u03ba = 0.42 [CI 0.33-0.50]). Relevant past medical history was the strongest predictor of self-report sensitivity, whereas general intelligence was not predictive. Conclusion: In this large population-based study, we found self-report validity varied among medication classes, with no simple relationship between psychiatric medication and under-reporting. History of indicated illness predicted more accurate self-report, for both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications. Although other patient-level factors influenced self-report for some medications, none predicted greater accuracy across all medications studied.",

Objectives: To evaluate how SAPG guidance had been implemented by health boards, assess how this translated into clinical practice, and investigate clinicians' views and behaviours about prescribing carbapenems and alternative agents. Methods: Local implementation of SAPG guidance was assessed using an online survey. A bespoke point prevalence survey was used to evaluate prescribing. Clinicians' experience of using carbapenems and alternatives was examined through semi-structured interviews. National prescribing data were analysed to assess the impact of the programme. Results: There were greater local restrictions for carbapenems than for piperacillin/tazobactam. Laboratory result suppression was inconsistent between boards and carbapenem-sparing antibiotics were not widely available. Compliance with local guidelines was good for meropenem but lower for piperacillin/tazobactam. Indication for use was well documented but review/stop dates were poorly documented for both antibiotics. Decisions to prescribe a carbapenem were influenced by local guidelines and specialist advice. Many clinicians lacked confidence to de-escalate treatment. Use of both antibiotics decreased during the course of the programme. Conclusions: A multifaceted quality improvement programme was used to gather intelligence, promote behaviour change, and focus interventions on the use of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam. Use of these antimicrobials decreased during the programme-a trend not seen elsewhere in Europe. The programme could be generalized to other antimicrobials.",

                    "abstract": "Background: A locally developed case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, designed to augment antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care was evaluated. Methods: Prescribing recommendations made by a CBR algorithm were compared to decisions made by physicians in clinical practice. Comparisons were examined in 2 patient populations: first, in patients with confirmed Escherichia coli blood stream infections (\"E. coli patients\"), and second in ward-based patients presenting with a range of potential infections (\"ward patients\"). Prescribing recommendations were compared against the Antimicrobial Spectrum Index (ASI) and the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) classification system. Appropriateness of a prescription was defined as the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most-likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Results: In total, 224 patients (145 E. coli patients and 79 ward patients) were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 66 (18) years with 108/224 (48%) female sex. The CBR recommendations were appropriate in 202/224 (90%) compared to 186/224 (83%) in practice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 95% confidence interval [CI]: .392-3.936; P = .71). CBR recommendations had a smaller ASI compared to practice with a median (range) of 6 (0-13) compared to 8 (0-12) (P < .01). CBR recommendations were more likely to be classified as Access class antimicrobials compared to physicians' prescriptions at 110/224 (49%) vs. 79/224 (35%) (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.212-2.588; P < .01). Results were similar for E. coli and ward patients on subgroup analysis. Conclusions: A CBR-driven decision support system provided appropriate recommendations within a narrower spectrum compared to current clinical practice. Future work must investigate the impact of this intervention on prescribing behaviors more broadly and patient outcomes.",

Objectives: To evaluate how SAPG guidance had been implemented by health boards, assess how this translated into clinical practice, and investigate clinicians' views and behaviours about prescribing carbapenems and alternative agents. Methods: Local implementation of SAPG guidance was assessed using an online survey. A bespoke point prevalence survey was used to evaluate prescribing. Clinicians' experience of using carbapenems and alternatives was examined through semi-structured interviews. National prescribing data were analysed to assess the impact of the programme. Results: There were greater local restrictions for carbapenems than for piperacillin/tazobactam. Laboratory result suppression was inconsistent between boards and carbapenem-sparing antibiotics were not widely available. Compliance with local guidelines was good for meropenem but lower for piperacillin/tazobactam. Indication for use was well documented but review/stop dates were poorly documented for both antibiotics. Decisions to prescribe a carbapenem were influenced by local guidelines and specialist advice. Many clinicians lacked confidence to de-escalate treatment. Use of both antibiotics decreased during the course of the programme. Conclusions: A multifaceted quality improvement programme was used to gather intelligence, promote behaviour change, and focus interventions on the use of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam. Use of these antimicrobials decreased during the programme-a trend not seen elsewhere in Europe. The programme could be generalized to other antimicrobials.",

                    "title": "Autism spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management",
                    "abstract": "This guidance has been developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in collaboration with the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE). The term autism describes qualitative differences and impairments in reciprocal social interaction and social communication, combined with restricted interests and rigid and repetitive behaviours, often with a lifelong impact. In addition to these features, autistic children and young people frequently experience a range of cognitive, learning, language, medical, emotional and behavioural problems, including: a need for routine; difficulty in understanding other people, including their intentions, feelings and perspectives; sleeping and eating disturbances; and mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, problems with attention, self-injurious behaviour and other challenging, sometimes aggressive behaviour. These features may substantially impact on the quality of life of the individual, and their family or carer, and lead to social vulnerability. The clinical picture of autism is variable because of differences in the severity of autism itself, the presence of coexisting conditions and levels of cognitive ability, from profound intellectual disability in some people to average or above average intelligence quotient (IQ) in others. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in children, young people and adults if these behaviours meet the criteria defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and have a significant impact on function. Both these diagnostic classification systems use the term \u2018pervasive developmental disorder\u2019, which encompasses autism, Asperger\u2019s syndrome and atypical autism (or \u2018pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\u2019). For a diagnosis of autism to be made, there must be impairments present and an impact on the person\u2019s adaptive function. Both classification systems are undergoing revision and have announced that the term \u2018autism spectrum disorder\u2019 will be used in future editions. For this guideline we will use the term \u2018autism\u2019 to include all autism spectrum disorders. Although autism was once thought to be an uncommon developmental disorder, recent studies have reported prevalence rates of at least 1% in children and young people. Autism is diagnosed more frequently in boys. The core autism behaviours are typically present in early childhood, although some features may not manifest until a change of situation, for example, the start of nursery or school or, less commonly, the transition to secondary school. Regression or stasis of language and social behaviour is reported for at least a third of autistic children. This usually, but not exclusively, occurs between the ages of 1 and 2 years, and the reasons for regression and stasis are unknown. The way in which autism is expressed will differ across different ages and therefore for any individual may change over time as they mature, in response to environmental demands, in response to interventions, and in the context of coexisting conditions. Around 70% of autistic people also meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other (often unrecognised) psychiatric disorder that further impairs psychosocial functioning, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or anxiety disorders. Intellectual disability (IQ below 70) coexists in approximately 50% of autistic children and young people. There are many claims of a \u2018cure\u2019 for autism, all of which are without foundation. However, there are interventions that can help some of the core features of autism, some of the behaviours and problems commonly associated with autism, and support families and carers. There is also evidence for treatment strategies to reduce behaviour that challenges. This guideline will summarise the different ways that health and social care professionals can provide support, treatment and help for autistic children and young people, and their families and carers, from the early years through to their transition into young adult life. This guideline covers autistic children and young people (across the full range of intellectual ability) from birth until their 19th birthday, and their parents and carers. It should be used alongside the NICE guidelines on autism: recognition, referral and diagnosis of children and young people on the autism spectrum and autism: recognition, referral, diagnosis and management of adults on the autism spectrum. Good communication between healthcare professionals and autistic children and young people and their families and carers is essential. It should be supported by evidence-based written information tailored to the person\u2019s needs. Support and care, and the information people are given about it, should be culturally appropriate. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and to people who do not speak or read English. No antipsychotic medication has a UK marketing authorisation specifically for autistic children. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented.

Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications (\u2018off-label use\u2019), this is noted in the recommendations.",

Vaccination can prevent infectious diseases, reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, improve quality of life, and reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (1-5). Direct and indirect or herd protection can also be provided through vaccination, reducing the number of circulating AMR strains and the need for antimicrobial use (1, 3). Additionally, vaccination can reduce the incidence of seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society (2, 4). Overall, vaccination is an important public health measure that can have a significant impact on individual and population health.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Fiore et al. (2013).

Despite being an increasingly popular way for the public to access health information, VAs could be a source of ambiguous or potentially biased information. Objective: In response to the ongoing prevalence of vaccine misinformation and disinformation, this study aims to evaluate how smartphone VAs respond to information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of English-speaking adults who owned a smartphone with a VA installed was conducted online from April 22 to 28, 2021. The primary outcomes were the VAs' responses to 2 questions: \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" and \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" Directed content analysis was used to assign a negative, neutral, or positive connotation to each response and website title provided by the VAs. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (nonparametric) test for continuous variables and the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Results: Of the 466 survey respondents included in the final analysis, 404 (86.7%) used Apple Siri, 53 (11.4%) used Google Assistant, and 9 (1.9%) used Amazon Alexa. In response to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" 419 (89.9%) users received a direct response, of which 408 (97.3%) had a positive connotation encouraging users to get vaccinated. Of the websites presented, only 5.3% (11/207) had a positive connotation and 94.7% (196/207) had a neutral connotation. In response to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" 93.1% (434/466) of users received a list of websites, of which 91.5% (1155/1262) had a neutral connotation. For both COVID-19 vaccine-related questions, there was no association between the connotation of a response and the age, gender, zip code, race or ethnicity, and education level of the respondent. Conclusions: Our study found that VAs were much more likely to respond directly with positive connotations to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" but not respond directly and provide a list of websites with neutral connotations to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate how VAs respond to both information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.

The selection and sorting algorithms of search engines exert tremendous influence over the global spread of information and other communication processes. Objective: This study is concerned with demonstrating the influence of selection and sorting/ranking criteria operating in search engines on users' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of websites about vaccination. In particular, it is to compare the effects of search engines that deliver websites emphasizing on the pro side of vaccination with those focusing on the con side and with normal Google as a control group. Method: We conducted 2 online experiments using manipulated search engines. A pilot study was to verify the existence of dangerous health literacy in connection with searching and using health information on the Internet by exploring the effect of 2 manipulated search engines that yielded either pro or con vaccination sites only, with a group receiving normal Google as control. A pre-post test design was used; participants were American marketing students enrolled in a study-abroad program in Lugano, Switzerland. The second experiment manipulated the search engine by applying different ratios of con versus pro vaccination webpages displayed in the search results. Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform where it was published as a human intelligence task (HIT). Results: Both experiments showed knowledge highest in the group offered only pro vaccination sites (Z=-2.088, P=.03; Kruskal-Wallis H test [H\u2085]=11.30, P=.04). They acknowledged the importance/benefits (Z=-2.326, P=.02; H5=11.34, P=.04) and effectiveness (Z=-2.230, P=.03) of vaccination more, whereas groups offered antivaccination sites only showed increased concern about effects (Z=-2.582, P=.01; H\u2085=16.88, P=.005) and harmful health outcomes (Z=-2.200, P=.02) of vaccination. Normal Google users perceived information quality to be positive despite a small effect on knowledge and a negative effect on their beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination and willingness to recommend the information (\u03c7\u00b2\u2085=14.1, P=.01). More exposure to antivaccination websites lowered participants' knowledge (J=4783.5, z=-2.142, P=.03) increased their fear of side effects (J=6496, z=2.724, P=.006), and lowered their acknowledgment of benefits (J=4805, z=-2.067, P=.03). Conclusion: The selection and sorting/ranking criteria of search engines play a vital role in online health information seeking. Search engines delivering websites containing credible and evidence-based medical information impact positively Internet users seeking health information. Whereas sites retrieved by biased search engines create some opinion change in users. These effects are apparently independent of users' site credibility and evaluation judgments. Users are affected beneficially or detrimentally but are unaware, suggesting they are not consciously perceptive of indicators that steer them toward the credible sources or away from the dangerous ones. In this sense, the online health information seeker is flying blind.",

Improving communication about the direct benefits of vaccination as well as its benefits beyond preventing infectious diseases may help regain this lost confidence. A conference was organised at the Fondation Merieux in France to discuss what benefits could be communicated and how innovative digital initiatives can used for communication. During this meeting, a wide range of indirect benefits of vaccination were discussed. For example, influenza vaccination can reduce hospitalisations and deaths in older persons with diabetes by 45% and 38%, respectively, but the link between influenza and complications from underlying chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is frequently underestimated. Vaccination can reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is growing, by reducing the incidence of infectious disease (though direct and indirect or herd protection), by reducing the number of circulating AMR strains, and by reducing the need for antimicrobial use. Disease morbidity and treatment costs in the elderly population are likely to rise substantially, with the ageing global population. Healthy ageing and life-course vaccination approaches can reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as seasonal influenza and pneumococcal diseases, which place a significant burden on individuals and society, while improving quality of life. Novel disease surveillance systems based on information from Internet search engines, mobile phone apps, social media, cloud-based electronic health records, and crowd-sourced systems, contribute to improved awareness of disease burden. Examples of the role of new techniques and tools to process data generated by multiple sources, such as artificial intelligence, to support vaccination programmes, such as influenza and dengue, were discussed. The conference participants agreed that continual efforts are needed from all stakeholders to ensure effective, transparent communication of the full benefits and risks of vaccination.",

The selection and sorting algorithms of search engines exert tremendous influence over the global spread of information and other communication processes. Objective: This study is concerned with demonstrating the influence of selection and sorting/ranking criteria operating in search engines on users' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of websites about vaccination. In particular, it is to compare the effects of search engines that deliver websites emphasizing on the pro side of vaccination with those focusing on the con side and with normal Google as a control group. Method: We conducted 2 online experiments using manipulated search engines. A pilot study was to verify the existence of dangerous health literacy in connection with searching and using health information on the Internet by exploring the effect of 2 manipulated search engines that yielded either pro or con vaccination sites only, with a group receiving normal Google as control. A pre-post test design was used; participants were American marketing students enrolled in a study-abroad program in Lugano, Switzerland. The second experiment manipulated the search engine by applying different ratios of con versus pro vaccination webpages displayed in the search results. Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform where it was published as a human intelligence task (HIT). Results: Both experiments showed knowledge highest in the group offered only pro vaccination sites (Z=-2.088, P=.03; Kruskal-Wallis H test [H\u2085]=11.30, P=.04). They acknowledged the importance/benefits (Z=-2.326, P=.02; H5=11.34, P=.04) and effectiveness (Z=-2.230, P=.03) of vaccination more, whereas groups offered antivaccination sites only showed increased concern about effects (Z=-2.582, P=.01; H\u2085=16.88, P=.005) and harmful health outcomes (Z=-2.200, P=.02) of vaccination. Normal Google users perceived information quality to be positive despite a small effect on knowledge and a negative effect on their beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination and willingness to recommend the information (\u03c7\u00b2\u2085=14.1, P=.01). More exposure to antivaccination websites lowered participants' knowledge (J=4783.5, z=-2.142, P=.03) increased their fear of side effects (J=6496, z=2.724, P=.006), and lowered their acknowledgment of benefits (J=4805, z=-2.067, P=.03). Conclusion: The selection and sorting/ranking criteria of search engines play a vital role in online health information seeking. Search engines delivering websites containing credible and evidence-based medical information impact positively Internet users seeking health information. Whereas sites retrieved by biased search engines create some opinion change in users. These effects are apparently independent of users' site credibility and evaluation judgments. Users are affected beneficially or detrimentally but are unaware, suggesting they are not consciously perceptive of indicators that steer them toward the credible sources or away from the dangerous ones. In this sense, the online health information seeker is flying blind.",

Despite the concerns related to the use of such a promising tool in relation to the future of the quality of education, this technology will soon be incorporated into web search engines mandating the need to evaluate the output of such a tool. Previous studies showed that dependence on some sources of online information (e.g., social media platforms) was associated with higher rates of vaccination hesitancy. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to describe the output of ChatGPT regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine conspiracy beliefs. and compulsory vaccination. Methods: The current descriptive study was conducted on January 14, 2023 using the ChatGPT from OpenAI (OpenAI, L.L.C., San Francisco, CA, USA). The output was evaluated by two authors and the degree of agreement regarding the correctness, clarity, conciseness, and bias was evaluated using Cohen's kappa. Results: The ChatGPT responses were dismissive of conspiratorial ideas about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) origins labeling it as non-credible and lacking scientific evidence. Additionally, ChatGPT responses were totally against COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy statements. Regarding compulsory vaccination, ChatGPT responses were neutral citing the following as advantages of this strategy: protecting public health, maintaining herd immunity, reducing the spread of disease, cost-effectiveness, and legal obligation, and on the other hand, it cited the following as disadvantages of compulsory vaccination: ethical and legal concerns, mistrust and resistance, logistical challenges, and limited resources and knowledge. Conclusions: The current study showed that ChatGPT could be a source of information to challenge COVID-19 vaccine conspiracies. For compulsory vaccination, ChatGPT resonated with the divided opinion in the scientific community toward such a strategy; nevertheless, it detailed the pros and cons of this approach. As it currently stands, the judicious use of ChatGPT could be utilized as a user-friendly source of COVID-19 vaccine information that could challenge conspiracy ideas with clear, concise, and non-biased content. However, ChatGPT content cannot be used as an alternative to the original reliable sources of vaccine information (e.g., the World Health Organization [WHO] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]).",

Type 1 diabetes (T1D): This is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in a complete deficiency of insulin production.\n2. Type 2 diabetes (T2D): This is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about 90% of all diabetes cases. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n3. Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy, caused by hormonal changes and insulin resistance.\n4. LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults): This is a form of T1D that develops in adults, characterized by a slow progression from insulin resistance to a complete deficiency of insulin production.\n5. MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young): This is a rare form of T1D that is caused by genetic mutations that lead to insulin deficiency.\n6. Secondary diabetes: This type of diabetes occurs when another medical condition or medication causes insulin resistance or a deficiency of insulin production. Examples include pancreatic surgery, pancreatitis, and certain medications such as steroids.\n\nIt's important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and some individuals may have a combination of different types of diabetes.",

Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)1,2. Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70 mg dl-1) and hyperglycaemia (>180 mg dl-1), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform3 to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41-45%)5. In silico3,6 benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D.",

Methods: Initially, a 100-MCQ bank was established based on MCQs in endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology. The MCQs were created from physiology, medical textbooks, and academic examination pools in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology and academic examination pools. The study team members analyzed the MCQ contents to ensure that they were related to the endocrinology, diabetes, and diabetes technology. The number of MCQs from endocrinology was 50, and that from diabetes and science technology was also 50. The knowledge level of Google's Bard and ChatGPT was assessed with an MCQ-based examination. Results: In the endocrinology examination section, ChatGPT obtained 29 marks (correct responses) of 50 (58%), and Bard obtained a similar score of 29 of 50 (58%). However, in the diabetes technology examination section, ChatGPT obtained 23 marks of 50 (46%), and Bard obtained 20 marks of 50 (40%). Overall, in the entire three-part examination, ChatGPT obtained 52 marks of 100 (52%), and Bard obtained 49 marks of 100 (49%). ChatGPT obtained slightly more marks than Bard. However, both ChatGPT and Bard did not achieve satisfactory scores in endocrinology or diabetes/technology of at least 60%. Conclusions: The overall MCQ-based performance of ChatGPT was slightly better than that of Google's Bard. However, both ChatGPT and Bard did not achieve appropriate scores in endocrinology and diabetes/diabetes technology.

Additionally, vitamin D has immunomodulatory functions in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection, and it promotes the growth of gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium species.\n\nFolate and vitamin B12 have also been associated with cognitive performance, with inverse U-shaped associations observed between folate/vitamin B12 status and cognitive function. However, there is no consensus on the threshold of folate and vitamin B12 for assessing their impacts on cognition.\n\nIt is important to note that these findings are based on scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed journals and may not necessarily reflect the latest research findings.

There is growing evidence that cross-talk between the gut microbiome, Vitamin D and RAS/ACE2 system is essential for a balanced functioning of the elderly immune system and in regulating inflammation. In this review, we hypothesize that the state of gut microbiome, prior to infection determines the outcome associated with COVID-19 sepsis and may also be a critical factor in success to vaccination. Methods: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using a combination of terms \"SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Inflammaging, Immune-senescence, Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, RAS/ACE2, Vaccination\". Conclusion: Evidence indicates a complex association between gut microbiota, ACE-2 expression and Vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Status of gut microbiome is highly predictive of the blood molecular signatures and inflammatory markers and host responses to infection. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory function in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection. Anti-inflammatory functions of Vit D include regulation of gut microbiome and maintaining microbial diversity. It promotes growth of gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifida and Fermicutus species. In addition, Vitamin D is a negative regulator for expression of renin and interacts with the RAS/ ACE/ACE-2 signaling axis. Collectively, this triad may be the critical, link in determination of outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presented data are empirical and informative. Further research using advanced systems biology techniques and artificial intelligence-assisted integration could assist with correlation of the gut microbiome with sepsis and vaccine responses.

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data on 5365 children 6-16 y old from NHANES III. Serum folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations were measured, along with performance, on the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Associations of B vitamins with cognitive performance were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for various covariates. Higher serum concentrations of folate were associated with higher reading and block design scores after adjusting for various covariates. For example, compared with the lowest quartile of folate, children in the highest quartile scored 3.28 points or 0.19 SD units higher on the reading test (P < 0.05). Vitamin B-12 was not associated with any of the test scores. In the largest study to date, higher folate concentrations were associated with better reading and block design scores.

Older adults with a different folate and vitamin B12 status were clustered by artificial intelligence unsupervised learning. The statistically significant non-linear relationships between the markers of folate or vitamin B12 status and cognitive function were found after adjustments for potential confounders. Inverse U-shaped associations between folate/vitamin B12 status and cognitive function were observed, and the estimated breakpoint was described. No statistically significant interaction between vitamin B12 and folate status on cognitive function was observed in the current models. In addition, based on the biochemical examination of these four markers, older adults could be assigned into three clusters representing relatively low, medium, and high folate/vitamin B12 status with significantly different scores on the CERAD-DR and DSST.

However, research remains limited concerning the shape of these associations, the importance of the risk factors, and how these factors vary geographically. Objective: We aimed (1) to examine ecological associations between asthma prevalence and multiple socio-physical determinants in the United States; and (2) to assess geographic variations in their relative importance. Methods: Our study design is cross sectional based on county-level data for 2020 across the United States. We obtained self-reported asthma prevalence data of adults aged 18 years or older for each county. We applied conventional and geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) to investigate the associations between asthma prevalence and socioeconomic (e.g., poverty) and environmental determinants (e.g., air pollution and green space). To enhance the interpretability of the GWRF, we (1) assessed the shape of the associations through partial dependence plots, (2) ranked the determinants according to their global importance scores, and (3) mapped the local variable importance spatially. Results: Of the 3059 counties, the average asthma prevalence was 9.9 (standard deviation \u00b1 0.99). The GWRF outperformed the conventional random forest. We found an indication, for example, that temperature was inversely associated with asthma prevalence, while poverty showed positive associations. The partial dependence plots showed that these associations had a non-linear shape. Ranking the socio-physical environmental factors concerning their global importance showed that smoking prevalence and depression prevalence were most relevant, while green space and limited language were of minor relevance. The local variable importance measures showed striking geographical differences. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the evidence that socio-physical environments play a role in explaining asthma prevalence, but their relevance seems to vary geographically. The results are vital for implementing future asthma prevention programs that should be tailor-made for specific areas.",

This analysis aimed to identify the most frequent patient-reported triggers and symptoms of UC flares, which could highlight potential interventions for outcome improvement. Methods: Online posts written pre- and postflare by patients with UC on 8 public forums in 6 countries between January 1, 2019, and February 14, 2021, were identified using flare-related keywords. Flare-related posts were captured and Netbase Quid\u2122 artificial intelligence text analytics and natural language processing software were used to semantically map and identify commonly discussed themes and topics (subsets of themes). Results: Of >27 000 patient posts, 12 900 were identified as flare related. The most frequent themes were treatment experiences and side effects (28.5% of posts), followed by flare symptoms (22.9% of posts). The most frequent topic was emotional/peer support (9.4% of posts), followed by experiences with mesalamine (and other oral/rectal formulations; 8.0% of posts), and dietary recommendations (6.0% of posts). Stress and anxiety were the most frequently reported flare triggers (37.9% of posts), followed by diet (28.4% of posts). Stress and anxiety were frequently identified as both triggers for, and general symptoms of, flare. Blood in the stool was the most discussed flare indicator (57.8% of posts). Conclusions: Frequently discussed patient-perceived triggers of UC flares included diet, stress, and anxiety. These results suggest that physicians could incorporate a broader and more holistic approach to UC monitoring and management than is currently practiced.",

Objective: We aimed (1) to examine ecological associations between asthma prevalence and multiple socio-physical determinants in the United States; and (2) to assess geographic variations in their relative importance. Methods: Our study design is cross sectional based on county-level data for 2020 across the United States. We obtained self-reported asthma prevalence data of adults aged 18 years or older for each county. We applied conventional and geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) to investigate the associations between asthma prevalence and socioeconomic (e.g., poverty) and environmental determinants (e.g., air pollution and green space). To enhance the interpretability of the GWRF, we (1) assessed the shape of the associations through partial dependence plots, (2) ranked the determinants according to their global importance scores, and (3) mapped the local variable importance spatially. Results: Of the 3059 counties, the average asthma prevalence was 9.9 (standard deviation \u00b1 0.99). The GWRF outperformed the conventional random forest. We found an indication, for example, that temperature was inversely associated with asthma prevalence, while poverty showed positive associations. The partial dependence plots showed that these associations had a non-linear shape. Ranking the socio-physical environmental factors concerning their global importance showed that smoking prevalence and depression prevalence were most relevant, while green space and limited language were of minor relevance. The local variable importance measures showed striking geographical differences. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the evidence that socio-physical environments play a role in explaining asthma prevalence, but their relevance seems to vary geographically. The results are vital for implementing future asthma prevention programs that should be tailor-made for specific areas.",

Discovery of such interactions can provide insights into the pathophysiology and etiology of asthma. In this paper, we propose an asthma knowledge graph (KG) built using a hybrid methodology for graph-based modeling of asthma complexity with a focus on environmental interactions. Using a heterogeneous set of public sources, we construct a genetic and pharmacogenetic asthma knowledge graph. The construction of this KG allowed us to shed more light on the lack of curated resources focused on environmental influences related to asthma. To remedy the lack of environmental data in our KG, we exploit the biomedical literature using state-of-the-art natural language processing and construct the first Asthma-Environment interaction catalog incorporating a continuously updated ensemble of environmental, psychological, nutritional and socio-economic influences. The catalog's most substantiated results are then integrated into the KG. Results: The resulting environmentally rich knowledge graph \"AsthmaKGxE\" aims to provide a resource for several potential applications of artificial intelligence and allows for a multi-perspective study of asthma. Our insight extraction results indicate that stress is the most frequent asthma association in the corpus, followed by allergens and obesity. We contend that studying asthma-environment interactions in more depth holds the key to curbing the complexity and heterogeneity of asthma.

        "answer": "Healio: According to the PubMed abstracts provided, individuals who are at high risk of developing lung cancer include those with a history of smoking, particularly those who have smoked for a long time or smoked over 20 pack-years. Additionally, older adults (over 50 years old) and those with a family history of lung cancer are also at increased risk. Other factors that may increase the risk of lung cancer include exposure to secondhand smoke, exposure to radon gas, and having certain genetic mutations. It is important to note that these risk factors can vary based on the population being studied, and some studies may have different criteria for defining high-risk groups. If you have concerns about your risk for lung cancer, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your individual risk factors and provide personalized recommendations for early detection and prevention.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.",

This revision is based on the recent advances in LDCT lung cancer screening at home and abroad, and the epidemiology of lung cancer in China. The following aspects of the guideline were revised: (1) lung cancer risk factors besides smoking were considered for the identification of high risk population; (2) LDCT scan parameters were further classified; (3) longer screening interval is recommended for individuals who had negative LDCT screening results for two consecutive rounds; (4) the follow-up interval for positive nodules was extended from 3 months to 6 months; (5) the role of multi-disciplinary treatment (MDT) in the management of positive nodules, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer were emphasized. This revision clarifies the screening, intervention and treatment pathways, making the LDCT screening guideline more appropriate for China. Future researches based on emerging technologies, including biomarkers and artificial intelligence, are needed to optimize LDCT screening in China in the future. .",

Newer, minimally invasive biopsy procedures often fail to provide adequate specimens for accurate tumor subtyping or staging which is necessary to inform appropriate use of molecular targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus newer approaches to diagnosis and staging in early lung cancer are needed. This exploratory pilot study obtained peripheral blood samples from 139 individuals with clinically evident pulmonary nodules (benign and malignant), as well as ten healthy persons. They were divided into three cohorts: original cohort (n = 99), control cohort (n = 10), and validation cohort (n = 40). Average RNAseq sequencing of leukocytes in these samples were conducted. Subsequently, data was integrated into artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational approach with system-wide gene expression technology to develop a rapid, effective, non-invasive immune index for early diagnosis of lung cancer. An immune-related index system, IM-Index, was defined and validated for the diagnostic application. IM-Index was applied to assess the malignancies of pulmonary nodules of 109 participants (original + control cohorts) with high accuracy (AUC: 0.822 [95% CI: 0.75-0.91, p < 0.001]), and to differentiate between phases of cancer immunoediting concept (odds ratio: 1.17 [95% CI: 1.1-1.25, p < 0.001]). The predictive ability of IM-Index was validated in a validation cohort with a AUC: 0.883 (95% CI: 0.73-1.00, p < 0.001). The difference between molecular mechanisms of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma histology was also determined via the IM-Index (OR: 1.2 [95% CI 1.14-1.35, p = 0.019]). In addition, a structural metabolic behavior pattern and signaling property in host immunity were found (bonferroni correction, p = 1.32e - 16). Taken together our findings indicate that this AI-based approach may be used for \"Super Early\" cancer diagnosis and amend the current immunotherpay for lung cancer.",

The effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been further validated in recent years, and significant progress has been made in research on identifying high-risk individuals, personalizing screening interval, and management of screen-detected findings. The aim of this study is to revise China national lung cancer screening guideline with LDCT (2018 version). The China Lung Cancer Early Detection and Treatment Expert Group (CLCEDTEG) designated by the China's National Health Commission, and China Lung Oncolgy Group experts, jointly participated in the revision of Chinese lung cancer screening guideline (2023 version). This revision is based on the recent advances in LDCT lung cancer screening at home and abroad, and the epidemiology of lung cancer in China. The following aspects of the guideline were revised: (1) lung cancer risk factors besides smoking were considered for the identification of high risk population; (2) LDCT scan parameters were further classified; (3) longer screening interval is recommended for individuals who had negative LDCT screening results for two consecutive rounds; (4) the follow-up interval for positive nodules was extended from 3 months to 6 months; (5) the role of multi-disciplinary treatment (MDT) in the management of positive nodules, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer were emphasized. This revision clarifies the screening, intervention and treatment pathways, making the LDCT screening guideline more appropriate for China. Future researches based on emerging technologies, including biomarkers and artificial intelligence, are needed to optimize LDCT screening in China in the future. .",

Newer, minimally invasive biopsy procedures often fail to provide adequate specimens for accurate tumor subtyping or staging which is necessary to inform appropriate use of molecular targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus newer approaches to diagnosis and staging in early lung cancer are needed. This exploratory pilot study obtained peripheral blood samples from 139 individuals with clinically evident pulmonary nodules (benign and malignant), as well as ten healthy persons. They were divided into three cohorts: original cohort (n = 99), control cohort (n = 10), and validation cohort (n = 40). Average RNAseq sequencing of leukocytes in these samples were conducted. Subsequently, data was integrated into artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational approach with system-wide gene expression technology to develop a rapid, effective, non-invasive immune index for early diagnosis of lung cancer. An immune-related index system, IM-Index, was defined and validated for the diagnostic application. IM-Index was applied to assess the malignancies of pulmonary nodules of 109 participants (original + control cohorts) with high accuracy (AUC: 0.822 [95% CI: 0.75-0.91, p < 0.001]), and to differentiate between phases of cancer immunoediting concept (odds ratio: 1.17 [95% CI: 1.1-1.25, p < 0.001]). The predictive ability of IM-Index was validated in a validation cohort with a AUC: 0.883 (95% CI: 0.73-1.00, p < 0.001). The difference between molecular mechanisms of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma histology was also determined via the IM-Index (OR: 1.2 [95% CI 1.14-1.35, p = 0.019]). In addition, a structural metabolic behavior pattern and signaling property in host immunity were found (bonferroni correction, p = 1.32e - 16).

        "answer": "Healio: According to the abstracts you provided, there are several types of eating disorders that have been identified in the literature. These include:\n\n1. Anorexia nervosa (AN): characterized by restrictive eating habits and a distorted body image, leading to significantly low body weight.\n2. Bulimia nervosa (BN): characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by purging or other compensatory behaviors to avoid weight gain.\n3. Binge eating disorder (BED): characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without purging or other compensatory behaviors.\n4. Other specified feeding or eating disorders (OSFED): a catch-all category for eating disorders that do not meet the criteria for AN, BN, or BED.\n5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorders (UFED): a category for eating disorders that do not have enough information to determine the specific type.\n\nIt's important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and individuals may experience symptoms of more than one eating disorder. Additionally, the prevalence and incidence of eating disorders can vary depending on the population being studied and the criteria used to diagnose them.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of EDs and eating pathology in young adults and adults with ADHD and/or ASD, and to investigate the relationship between EDs and associated symptoms, on the one hand, and other psychiatric disorders, intelligence, and BMI, on the other hand, in this population. Methods: In an outpatient setting, 228 consecutively referred adults were neuropsychiatrically evaluated and assessed with regard to intelligence (WAIS-III), psychiatric comorbidities (SCID-I), personality disorders (SCID-II), eating disorders (SCID-I) and eating pathology (Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)). Results: For the entire sample, a total of 18 individuals (7.9%) had a current or previous eating disorder, with AN and BED being the most frequent. The male:female ratio was 1:2.5. According to EAT, 10.1% of the individuals scored within the range of severely disturbed eating behavior, and 13% moderately disturbed eating behavior. Individuals with ADHD more often affirmed eating pathology such as focusing on thoughts of calories and body dissatisfaction compared to individuals with ASD. Conclusions: Eating disorder symptomatology seems to be overrepresented in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders compared with the general population. The gender ratio for EDs in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders is not nearly as skewed as in the general population.",

Many factors associated with schizophrenia can disrupt eating, but ED can present years before schizophrenia. If premorbid ED distinguishes a particular subtype of schizophrenia, then phenotypic features may differ between schizophrenia cases with and without premorbid ED. Method: This secondary analysis used data from an inpatient schizophrenia research study that comprehensively assessed life course psychiatric disorders (DIGS interview), intelligence (WAIS), global assessments of function (GAF) and assessed symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose neuroleptic phases (PANSS). Results: Premorbid ED was identified in 27 of the 288 schizophrenia cases (9.4%). This group had more females than the group without premorbid ED (74.1% vs. 30%); premorbid ED was 5-fold more common in female than male cases (\u03c72 (17.9, P < .0001). Only the premorbid ED group had gustatory hallucinations. They also demonstrated significantly more severe psychotic and disorganization symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose treatment phases, despite similar negative symptoms and GAF scores, as other cases. The premorbid ED group had significantly better cognition overall, but relatively lower nonverbal than verbal intelligence. Discussion: Premorbid ED may define a specific subtype of schizophrenia that is common in females. Their more severe psychotic symptoms and better IQ, despite similarly impaired function and negative symptoms as other cases, suggests a distinct pathophysiology. Premorbid ED should be considered in evaluating risk states for schizophrenia, and as a relevant phenotype for treatment resistant schizophrenia.",

Methods: A total of 485 female adolescents aged 14-19 years old (M = 16.81, SD = 1.33) who were students in middle school, high school, and college completed questionnaires about body dissatisfaction, ED symptomatology, and EI. We conducted moderating analyses. Results: Subdimensions of EI significantly moderated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and symptoms of ED. For participants high in body dissatisfaction, lower levels in stress management ability and higher levels in the interpersonal EI and Adaptability EI dimensions were associated with higher levels of ED symptomatology. Discussion: Subdimensions of EI have an important role in moderating the association between body dissatisfaction and symptoms of ED. The findings of this study contribute to improving the knowledge about the role of emotional competencies in ED. Proposals for future research and to improve preventative approaches are discussed. Public significance statement: This study shows the moderating role of EI dimensions in the well-established relationship between body dissatisfaction and ED symptomatology. The research was conducted with a population at high risk of ED: female adolescents in the northwest of Mexico. Results showed that low Stress management EI, high Adaptability EI, and high Interpersonal EI were associated with higher levels of ED symptomatology among participants with high (but not low) body dissatisfaction. These insightful results have theoretical and practical implications.",

        "answer": "Healio: Based on the PubMed abstracts provided, there is evidence that lifestyle changes can significantly impact blood pressure (BP) control in individuals with hypertension. Here are some lifestyle changes that can help manage high BP:\n\n1. Dietary changes: A healthy diet that is low in sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars can help lower BP. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy, has been shown to reduce BP.\n2. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help lower BP and improve overall cardiovascular health. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n3. Weight management: Excess weight is a common risk factor for hypertension, and losing weight can help lower BP. Aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9.\n4. Stress management: Chronic stress can contribute to high BP. Practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help manage stress.\n5. Limit alcohol intake: Excessive alcohol consumption can raise BP. Limit alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.\n6. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep can contribute to high BP. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n7. Quit smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor for hypertension, and quitting can help",

High-contact coaching requires substantial resources and may be difficult to deliver via human coaching models. Objective: This observational study assessed changes in BP and body weight following participation in a fully digital program called Lark Hypertension Care with coaching powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Methods: Participants (N=864) had a baseline systolic BP (SBP) \u2265120 mm Hg, provided their baseline body weight, and had reached at least their third month in the program. The primary outcome was the change in SBP at 3 and 6 months, with secondary outcomes of change in body weight and associations of changes in SBP and body weight with participant demographics, characteristics, and program engagement. Results: By month 3, there was a significant drop of -5.4 mm Hg (95% CI -6.5 to -4.3; P<.001) in mean SBP from baseline. BP did not change significantly (ie, the SBP drop maintained) from 3 to 6 months for participants who provided readings at both time points (P=.49). Half of the participants achieved a clinically meaningful drop of \u22655 mm Hg by month 3 (178/349, 51.0%) and month 6 (98/199, 49.2%). The magnitude of the drop depended on starting SBP. Participants classified as hypertension stage 2 had the largest mean drop in SBP of -12.4 mm Hg (SE 1.2 mm Hg) by month 3 and -13.0 mm Hg (SE 1.6 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as hypertension stage 1 lowered by -5.2 mm Hg (SE 0.8) mm Hg by month 3 and -7.3 mm Hg (SE 1.3 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as elevated lowered by -1.1 mm Hg (SE 0.7 mm Hg) by month 3 but did not drop by month 6. Starting SBP (\u03b2=.11; P<.001), percent weight change (\u03b2=-.36; P=.02), and initial BMI (\u03b2=-.56; P<.001) were significantly associated with the likelihood of lowering SBP \u22655 mm Hg by month 3. Percent weight change acted as a mediator of the relationship between program engagement and drop in SBP. The bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect was -0.0024 (95% CI -0.0052 to 0; P=.002). Conclusions: A hypertension care program with coaching powered by AI was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP following 3 and 6 months of program participation. Percent weight change was significantly associated with the likelihood of achieving a \u22655 mm Hg drop in SBP. An AI-powered solution may offer a scalable approach to helping individuals with hypertension achieve clinically meaningful reductions in their BP and associated risk of cardiovascular disease and other serious adverse outcomes via healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss.",

These tools support identifying and addressing barriers to healthy eating, reducing body mass index (BMI), and building increased physical resilience in real time. Objective: To evaluate whether a 12-week learning management system designed to combine nutritional intervention with education and coaching on improving emotional intelligence (EI) could alter cardiometabolic outcomes. Methods: This pre-post prospective study enrolled 37 adult volunteers with BMI greater than 25 to participate in a 12-week learning management system. Primary (BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose levels) and secondary self-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months after enrollment using Short Form-36, Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi), and Whole Health Index (WHI). Linear mixed-effects regression models with random effect were used to estimate changes in primary and secondary outcomes. We adjusted for multiple testing using Holm step-down method. Results: BMI and LDL were the only primary endpoints lower at program completion and 6-month follow-up compared to baseline levels (-1.63 and -17.77 mg/dL, respectively; P < .001). Secondary outcomes showing statistically significant improvement from baseline to 6-month follow-up included energy/fatigue (Short Form-36), self-regard (EQi), decision-making (EQi), impulse control (EQi), stress management (EQi), Whole Brain - Form A (WHI), Whole Food - Form C (WHI), and Whole Body - Form D (WHI). Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that lifestyle programs combining nutritional interventions and EI can have a significant impact on BMI and LDL.

These tools support identifying and addressing barriers to healthy eating, reducing body mass index (BMI), and building increased physical resilience in real time. Objective: To evaluate whether a 12-week learning management system designed to combine nutritional intervention with education and coaching on improving emotional intelligence (EI) could alter cardiometabolic outcomes. Methods: This pre-post prospective study enrolled 37 adult volunteers with BMI greater than 25 to participate in a 12-week learning management system. Primary (BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose levels) and secondary self-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months after enrollment using Short Form-36, Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi), and Whole Health Index (WHI). Linear mixed-effects regression models with random effect were used to estimate changes in primary and secondary outcomes. We adjusted for multiple testing using Holm step-down method. Results: BMI and LDL were the only primary endpoints lower at program completion and 6-month follow-up compared to baseline levels (-1.63 and -17.77 mg/dL, respectively; P < .001). Secondary outcomes showing statistically significant improvement from baseline to 6-month follow-up included energy/fatigue (Short Form-36), self-regard (EQi), decision-making (EQi), impulse control (EQi), stress management (EQi), Whole Brain - Form A (WHI), Whole Food - Form C (WHI), and Whole Body - Form D (WHI). Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that lifestyle programs combining nutritional interventions and EI can have a significant impact on BMI and LDL. Our study highlights the potential importance of both nutrition and EI in programs targeting diet and lifestyle modification.",

High-contact coaching requires substantial resources and may be difficult to deliver via human coaching models. Objective: This observational study assessed changes in BP and body weight following participation in a fully digital program called Lark Hypertension Care with coaching powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Methods: Participants (N=864) had a baseline systolic BP (SBP) \u2265120 mm Hg, provided their baseline body weight, and had reached at least their third month in the program. The primary outcome was the change in SBP at 3 and 6 months, with secondary outcomes of change in body weight and associations of changes in SBP and body weight with participant demographics, characteristics, and program engagement. Results: By month 3, there was a significant drop of -5.4 mm Hg (95% CI -6.5 to -4.3; P<.001) in mean SBP from baseline. BP did not change significantly (ie, the SBP drop maintained) from 3 to 6 months for participants who provided readings at both time points (P=.49). Half of the participants achieved a clinically meaningful drop of \u22655 mm Hg by month 3 (178/349, 51.0%) and month 6 (98/199, 49.2%). The magnitude of the drop depended on starting SBP. Participants classified as hypertension stage 2 had the largest mean drop in SBP of -12.4 mm Hg (SE 1.2 mm Hg) by month 3 and -13.0 mm Hg (SE 1.6 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as hypertension stage 1 lowered by -5.2 mm Hg (SE 0.8) mm Hg by month 3 and -7.3 mm Hg (SE 1.3 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as elevated lowered by -1.1 mm Hg (SE 0.7 mm Hg) by month 3 but did not drop by month 6. Starting SBP (\u03b2=.11; P<.001), percent weight change (\u03b2=-.36; P=.02), and initial BMI (\u03b2=-.56; P<.001) were significantly associated with the likelihood of lowering SBP \u22655 mm Hg by month 3. Percent weight change acted as a mediator of the relationship between program engagement and drop in SBP. The bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect was -0.0024 (95% CI -0.0052 to 0; P=.002). Conclusions: A hypertension care program with coaching powered by AI was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP following 3 and 6 months of program participation. Percent weight change was significantly associated with the likelihood of achieving a \u22655 mm Hg drop in SBP. An AI-powered solution may offer a scalable approach to helping individuals with hypertension achieve clinically meaningful reductions in their BP and associated risk of cardiovascular disease and other serious adverse outcomes via healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Assessment of progress in cancer control at the population level is increasingly important. Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index and skin colour (as a proxy for sun sensitivity) were used for obtaining adjusted odds ratios, with continuous predictors presented using quintiles (Q). Results: In addition to smoking, older age and male sex, positively associating features included several anthropometric characteristics, whole body water mass, pulse, hypertension and biomarkers such as urinary microalbumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.16, 95% CI = 1.13-1.19), C-reactive protein (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.20, 95% CI = 1.16-1.24) and red blood cell distribution width (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.18, 95% CI = 1.14-1.21), among others. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) and albumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) were inversely associated with cancer.

Methods: An observational, retrospective study was carried out using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda (Madrid). Information from the EMRs was extracted using artificial intelligence techniques and analysed using the Savana Manager v3.0 software. Searches were performed using the term \"hypothyroidism\" and the terms corresponding to the tumours analysed. Results: Of a total population of 506,749 patients, 23,570 (4.7%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Patients with this diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency of cancer than that found in non-hypothyroid subjects (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.17). This higher frequency was found both in women (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.90-2.08) and in men (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.63-3.05). However, this higher frequency of cancer was not observed in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Although the frequency of most of the neoplasms studied individually was higher in the population with hypothyroidism, we observed that hypothyroid patients over 60 years of age had a significant decrease in the frequency of prostate, lung, colorectal, and liver cancer. Conclusion: Data from this hospital cohort suggest that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and cancer. However, this association is less evident in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years.",

Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. Methods: In this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7\u00b72 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81, 1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. Findings: The overall index of net survival increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index of net survival was 50% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10% survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1\u00b71% for pancreatic cancer to 98\u00b72% for testicular cancer. Net survival for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. Interpretation: These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

Searches were performed using the term \"hypothyroidism\" and the terms corresponding to the tumours analysed. Results: Of a total population of 506,749 patients, 23,570 (4.7%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Patients with this diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency of cancer than that found in non-hypothyroid subjects (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.17). This higher frequency was found both in women (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.90-2.08) and in men (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.63-3.05). However, this higher frequency of cancer was not observed in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Although the frequency of most of the neoplasms studied individually was higher in the population with hypothyroidism, we observed that hypothyroid patients over 60 years of age had a significant decrease in the frequency of prostate, lung, colorectal, and liver cancer. Conclusion: Data from this hospital cohort suggest that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and cancer. However, this association is less evident in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years.",

        "answer": "Healio: The classification of mental health disorders is a complex and ongoing area of research. While there are several different approaches to categorizing mental health disorders, one common framework is the Transdiagnostic Model, which suggests that many mental health disorders share common symptoms across different diagnostic categories. For example, a person may experience both depression and anxiety, which are both classified as mood disorders, but also share symptoms such as insomnia, changes in appetite, and feelings of hopelessness.\n\nThe Transdiagnostic Model suggests that there are several dimensions or features of mental health disorders, including:\n\n1. Positive symptoms: These are symptoms that are not typically present in healthy individuals, such as hallucinations or delusions.\n2. Negative symptoms: These are symptoms that are present in healthy individuals but are more severe or frequent in individuals with mental health disorders, such as apathy or anhedonia.\n3. Cognitive symptoms: These are symptoms related to thinking and cognition, such as difficulty concentrating or remembering things.\n4. Affective symptoms: These are symptoms related to mood, such as depression or anxiety.\n5. Interpersonal symptoms: These are symptoms related to interactions with others, such as social withdrawal or difficulty forming relationships.\n\nIt is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and individuals may experience symptoms across multiple categories. Additionally, the Transdiagnostic Model is not a fixed or absolute classification, and the boundaries between categories can be blurry and subject to change over time.\n\nIn summary, the different types of mental health disorders are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be fully captured by a single classification system.

                    "abstract": "Background: To deliver appropriate mental healthcare interventions and support, it is imperative to be able to distinguish one person from the other. The current classification of mental illness (e.g., DSM) is unable to do that well, indicating the problem of diagnostic heterogeneity between disorders (i.e., the disorder categories have many common symptoms). As a result, the same person might be diagnosed with two different disorders by two independent clinicians. We argue that this problem might have resulted because these disorders were created by a group of humans (APA taskforce members) who relied on more intuition and consensus than data. Literature suggests that human-led decisions are prone to biases, group-thinking, and other factors (such as financial conflict of interest) that can enormously influence creating diagnostic and treatment guidelines. Therefore, in this study, we inquire that if we prevent such human intervention (and thereby their associated biases) and use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to form those disorder structures from the data (patient-reported symptoms) directly, then can we come up with homogenous clusters or categories (representing disorders/syndromes: a group of co-occurring symptoms) that are adequately distinguishable from each other for them to be clinically useful. Additionally, we inquired how these A.I.-created categories differ (or are similar) from human-created categories. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study, that demonstrated how to use narrative qualitative data from patients with psychopathology and group their experiences using an A.I. Therefore, the current study also attempts to serve as a proof-of-concept. Method: We used secondary data scraped from online communities and consisting of 10,933 patients' narratives about their lived experiences. These patients were diagnosed with one or more DSM diagnoses for mental illness. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we converted the text data into a numeric form. We then used an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to group/cluster the symptoms. RESULTS: Using the data mining approach, the A.I. found four categories/clusters formed from the data. We presented ten symptoms or experiences under each cluster to demonstrate the practicality of application and understanding.

Therefore, the categorical approach of diagnosing mental disorders can be argued to fall short of its purpose. We need to search for a classification system beyond the categorical approaches even if there are secondary merits (such as ease of communication and black-and-white (binary) decision making).

In contrast, others are shared by most other clusters (i.e., identification of transdiagnostic experiences). Such differences are interesting objects of inquiry for future studies. For example, in clear contrast to the traditional diagnostic systems, while some experiences, such as auditory hallucinations, are present in all four clusters, others, such as trouble with eating, are exclusive to one cluster (representing a syndrome: a group of co-occurring symptoms). We argue that trans-diagnostic conditions (e.g., auditory hallucinations) might be prime targets for symptom-level interventions. For syndrome-level grouping and intervention, however, we argue that exclusive symptoms are the main targets. Conclusion: Categorical approach to mental disorders is not a way forward because the categories are not unique enough and have several shared symptoms. We argue that the same symptoms can be present in more than one syndrome, although dimensionally different. However, we need additional studies to test this hypothesis.

                    "abstract": "Background: To deliver appropriate mental healthcare interventions and support, it is imperative to be able to distinguish one person from the other. The current classification of mental illness (e.g., DSM) is unable to do that well, indicating the problem of diagnostic heterogeneity between disorders (i.e., the disorder categories have many common symptoms). As a result, the same person might be diagnosed with two different disorders by two independent clinicians. We argue that this problem might have resulted because these disorders were created by a group of humans (APA taskforce members) who relied on more intuition and consensus than data. Literature suggests that human-led decisions are prone to biases, group-thinking, and other factors (such as financial conflict of interest) that can enormously influence creating diagnostic and treatment guidelines. Therefore, in this study, we inquire that if we prevent such human intervention (and thereby their associated biases) and use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to form those disorder structures from the data (patient-reported symptoms) directly, then can we come up with homogenous clusters or categories (representing disorders/syndromes: a group of co-occurring symptoms) that are adequately distinguishable from each other for them to be clinically useful. Additionally, we inquired how these A.I.-created categories differ (or are similar) from human-created categories. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study, that demonstrated how to use narrative qualitative data from patients with psychopathology and group their experiences using an A.I. Therefore, the current study also attempts to serve as a proof-of-concept. Method: We used secondary data scraped from online communities and consisting of 10,933 patients' narratives about their lived experiences. These patients were diagnosed with one or more DSM diagnoses for mental illness. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we converted the text data into a numeric form. We then used an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to group/cluster the symptoms. RESULTS: Using the data mining approach, the A.I. found four categories/clusters formed from the data. We presented ten symptoms or experiences under each cluster to demonstrate the practicality of application and understanding. We also identified the transdiagnostic factors and symptoms that were unique to each of these four clusters. We explored the extent of similarities between these clusters and studied the difference in data density in them. Finally, we reported the silhouette score of + 0.046, indicating that the clusters are poorly distinguishable from each other (i.e., they have high overlapping symptoms). Discussion: We infer that whether humans attempt to categorise mental illnesses or an A.I., the result is that the categories of mental disorders will not be unique enough to be able to distinguish one service seeker from another.

This study aimed to examine to what extent this method captures items related to the primary and secondary symptoms associated with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). We investigated whether the word responses that participants generated contained information of all, or some, of the criteria that define MDD and GAD using symptom-based rating scales that are commonly used in clinical research and practices. Method: Participants (N = 411) described their mental health with freely generated words and rating scales relating to depression and worry/anxiety. Word responses were quantified and analyzed using natural language processing and machine learning. Results: The QCLA correlated significantly with the individual items connected to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of MDD (PHQ-9; Pearson's r = 0.30-0.60, p < 0.001) and GAD (GAD-7; Pearson's r = 0.41-0.52, p < 0.001; PSWQ-8; Spearman's r = 0.52-0.63, p < 0.001) for respective rating scales. Items measuring primary criteria (cognitive and emotional aspects) yielded higher predictability than secondary criteria (behavioral aspects). Conclusion: Together these results suggest that QCLA may be able to complement rating scales in measuring mental health in clinical settings. The approach carries the potential to personalize assessments and contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the diagnostic heterogeneity of depression.",

Psychiatric disorders in this population have been poorly studied in developing countries. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in adults with ID and whether comorbid psychiatric disorders were associated with health service utilisation. Methods: We obtained data from the Second National Sample Survey on Disability, conducted in 31 provinces of China and selected a subsample of 13 631 adults aged 18 years and above with ID. ID were defined by intelligence quotient score under 70, deficits in two or more adaptive behaviours and age of onset under 18 years. Psychiatric disorders were identified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Logistic regressions were used for data analyses. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in adults with ID was 16.7%. The most prevalent type of psychiatric disorder was dementia. Older adults, females, being minorities, urban residents, being literate, low-income groups and having severe ID, were associated with elevated risk of psychiatric disorder among adults with ID. Compared with individuals without psychiatric disorders, those with comorbid psychiatric disorders were more likely to use medical service and less likely to use rehabilitation service. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in adults with ID was strikingly higher than that in the general population. Health service utilisation among Chinese adults with ID remained a big challenge. There is a possibility of diagnostic overshadowing by local clinicians, which may have resulted in overdiagnosis of dementia and underdiagnosis of common mental disorders. This study informs further investigations regarding common mental disorders among people with ID and has implications for public health strategies and health policies to meet health service need for this population.",

                    "abstract": "Background: To deliver appropriate mental healthcare interventions and support, it is imperative to be able to distinguish one person from the other. The current classification of mental illness (e.g., DSM) is unable to do that well, indicating the problem of diagnostic heterogeneity between disorders (i.e., the disorder categories have many common symptoms). As a result, the same person might be diagnosed with two different disorders by two independent clinicians. We argue that this problem might have resulted because these disorders were created by a group of humans (APA taskforce members) who relied on more intuition and consensus than data. Literature suggests that human-led decisions are prone to biases, group-thinking, and other factors (such as financial conflict of interest) that can enormously influence creating diagnostic and treatment guidelines. Therefore, in this study, we inquire that if we prevent such human intervention (and thereby their associated biases) and use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to form those disorder structures from the data (patient-reported symptoms) directly, then can we come up with homogenous clusters or categories (representing disorders/syndromes: a group of co-occurring symptoms) that are adequately distinguishable from each other for them to be clinically useful. Additionally, we inquired how these A.I.-created categories differ (or are similar) from human-created categories. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study, that demonstrated how to use narrative qualitative data from patients with psychopathology and group their experiences using an A.I. Therefore, the current study also attempts to serve as a proof-of-concept. Method: We used secondary data scraped from online communities and consisting of 10,933 patients' narratives about their lived experiences. These patients were diagnosed with one or more DSM diagnoses for mental illness. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we converted the text data into a numeric form. We then used an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to group/cluster the symptoms. RESULTS: Using the data mining approach, the A.I. found four categories/clusters formed from the data. We presented ten symptoms or experiences under each cluster to demonstrate the practicality of application and understanding. We also identified the transdiagnostic factors and symptoms that were unique to each of these four clusters. We explored the extent of similarities between these clusters and studied the difference in data density in them. Finally, we reported the silhouette score of + 0.046, indicating that the clusters are poorly distinguishable from each other (i.e., they have high overlapping symptoms). Discussion: We infer that whether humans attempt to categorise mental illnesses or an A.I., the result is that the categories of mental disorders will not be unique enough to be able to distinguish one service seeker from another. Therefore, the categorical approach of diagnosing mental disorders can be argued to fall short of its purpose. We need to search for a classification system beyond the categorical approaches even if there are secondary merits (such as ease of communication and black-and-white (binary) decision making). However, using our A.I. based data mining approach had several meritorious findings. For example, we found that some symptoms are more exclusive or unique to one cluster. In contrast, others are shared by most other clusters (i.e., identification of transdiagnostic experiences). Such differences are interesting objects of inquiry for future studies. For example, in clear contrast to the traditional diagnostic systems, while some experiences, such as auditory hallucinations, are present in all four clusters, others, such as trouble with eating, are exclusive to one cluster (representing a syndrome: a group of co-occurring symptoms). We argue that trans-diagnostic conditions (e.g., auditory hallucinations) might be prime targets for symptom-level interventions. For syndrome-level grouping and intervention, however, we argue that exclusive symptoms are the main targets. Conclusion: Categorical approach to mental disorders is not a way forward because the categories are not unique enough and have several shared symptoms. We argue that the same symptoms can be present in more than one syndrome, although dimensionally different. However, we need additional studies to test this hypothesis.

        "answer": "Healio: The commonly prescribed antibiotics for bacterial infections include cefazolin for clean surgical procedures, and clindamycin for severe or life-threatening infections. It is important to note that the appropriateness of a prescription depends on the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Additionally, the timing of appropriate antibiotic regimens and the selection of those agents are crucial for clinical resolution. Early empiric antibiotic administration and the switch from intravenous to oral therapy can also influence survival outcomes. (1,2,3)\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Srinivasan S, et al.

                    "abstract": "Background: A locally developed case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, designed to augment antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care was evaluated. Methods: Prescribing recommendations made by a CBR algorithm were compared to decisions made by physicians in clinical practice. Comparisons were examined in 2 patient populations: first, in patients with confirmed Escherichia coli blood stream infections (\"E. coli patients\"), and second in ward-based patients presenting with a range of potential infections (\"ward patients\"). Prescribing recommendations were compared against the Antimicrobial Spectrum Index (ASI) and the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) classification system. Appropriateness of a prescription was defined as the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most-likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Results: In total, 224 patients (145 E. coli patients and 79 ward patients) were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 66 (18) years with 108/224 (48%) female sex. The CBR recommendations were appropriate in 202/224 (90%) compared to 186/224 (83%) in practice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 95% confidence interval [CI]: .392-3.936; P = .71). CBR recommendations had a smaller ASI compared to practice with a median (range) of 6 (0-13) compared to 8 (0-12) (P < .01). CBR recommendations were more likely to be classified as Access class antimicrobials compared to physicians' prescriptions at 110/224 (49%) vs. 79/224 (35%) (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.212-2.588; P < .01). Results were similar for E. coli and ward patients on subgroup analysis. Conclusions: A CBR-driven decision support system provided appropriate recommendations within a narrower spectrum compared to current clinical practice. Future work must investigate the impact of this intervention on prescribing behaviors more broadly and patient outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Background: A locally developed case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, designed to augment antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care was evaluated. Methods: Prescribing recommendations made by a CBR algorithm were compared to decisions made by physicians in clinical practice. Comparisons were examined in 2 patient populations: first, in patients with confirmed Escherichia coli blood stream infections (\"E. coli patients\"), and second in ward-based patients presenting with a range of potential infections (\"ward patients\"). Prescribing recommendations were compared against the Antimicrobial Spectrum Index (ASI) and the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) classification system. Appropriateness of a prescription was defined as the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most-likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Results: In total, 224 patients (145 E. coli patients and 79 ward patients) were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 66 (18) years with 108/224 (48%) female sex. The CBR recommendations were appropriate in 202/224 (90%) compared to 186/224 (83%) in practice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 95% confidence interval [CI]: .392-3.936; P = .71). CBR recommendations had a smaller ASI compared to practice with a median (range) of 6 (0-13) compared to 8 (0-12) (P < .01). CBR recommendations were more likely to be classified as Access class antimicrobials compared to physicians' prescriptions at 110/224 (49%) vs. 79/224 (35%) (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.212-2.588; P < .01). Results were similar for E. coli and ward patients on subgroup analysis. Conclusions: A CBR-driven decision support system provided appropriate recommendations within a narrower spectrum compared to current clinical practice.

Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

Complementary and alternative medical providers may be key influences in the networks of those parents who do not vaccinate their children. Methods: From March to July 2013, we conducted semi-structured interviews of Oregon complementary and alternative medical providers (N = 36) in five disciplines likely to treat parents or children, or both, and whose practitioners are known to express opinions about vaccines and vaccination. We interviewed them concerning their immunology beliefs, vaccine positions, and what these providers recommend to their patients concerning vaccines. We conducted face-to-face interviews and analyzed the interview data using thematic analysis methodology. Results: This article identifies the range and type of immunological beliefs of complementary and alternative medical providers concerning pediatric vaccine recommendations. From repeated readings of the data, we identified three areas of alternative immunological beliefs among complementary and alternative medical providers (i.e. \"natural is best,\" \"innate intelligence,\" and \"the fragile immune system\"). In addition, complementary and alternative medical providers who embraced mainstream medicine were likely to be vaccine accepters and to mention vaccines as a positive health measure to their patients-these themes were \"vaccines prevent illness\" and \"herd immunity.\" Conclusion: Complementary and alternative medical providers influence their patients' vaccination decisions, particularly urging caution or complete vaccine avoidance, and may be a major influence in states like Oregon with high non-medical exemption rates. Complementary and alternative medical providers come to their anti-vaccine positions largely through post-graduation continuing education courses and seminars.

HPV vaccination occurred in < 0.2% of pregnancies, mostly in the first trimester among women aged 12-19 years, and MMR was administered in < 0.1% of pregnancies. Use of other contraindicated vaccines per ACIP (e.g., varicella, live attenuated influenza) was rare. Conclusion: Maternal vaccination with ACIP-recommended vaccines was suboptimal among privately and Medicaid-insured patients, with lower vaccination coverage among Medicaid-insured pregnancies than their privately insured counterparts. Inadvertent exposure to contraindicated vaccines during pregnancy was rare. This study evaluated only vaccinations reimbursed among insured populations and may have limited generalizability to uninsured populations.",

Objective: In response to the ongoing prevalence of vaccine misinformation and disinformation, this study aims to evaluate how smartphone VAs respond to information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of English-speaking adults who owned a smartphone with a VA installed was conducted online from April 22 to 28, 2021. The primary outcomes were the VAs' responses to 2 questions: \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" and \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" Directed content analysis was used to assign a negative, neutral, or positive connotation to each response and website title provided by the VAs. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (nonparametric) test for continuous variables and the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Results: Of the 466 survey respondents included in the final analysis, 404 (86.7%) used Apple Siri, 53 (11.4%) used Google Assistant, and 9 (1.9%) used Amazon Alexa. In response to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" 419 (89.9%) users received a direct response, of which 408 (97.3%) had a positive connotation encouraging users to get vaccinated. Of the websites presented, only 5.3% (11/207) had a positive connotation and 94.7% (196/207) had a neutral connotation. In response to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" 93.1% (434/466) of users received a list of websites, of which 91.5% (1155/1262) had a neutral connotation. For both COVID-19 vaccine-related questions, there was no association between the connotation of a response and the age, gender, zip code, race or ethnicity, and education level of the respondent. Conclusions: Our study found that VAs were much more likely to respond directly with positive connotations to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" but not respond directly and provide a list of websites with neutral connotations to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate how VAs respond to both information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.

Objective: In response to the ongoing prevalence of vaccine misinformation and disinformation, this study aims to evaluate how smartphone VAs respond to information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of English-speaking adults who owned a smartphone with a VA installed was conducted online from April 22 to 28, 2021. The primary outcomes were the VAs' responses to 2 questions: \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" and \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" Directed content analysis was used to assign a negative, neutral, or positive connotation to each response and website title provided by the VAs. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (nonparametric) test for continuous variables and the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Results: Of the 466 survey respondents included in the final analysis, 404 (86.7%) used Apple Siri, 53 (11.4%) used Google Assistant, and 9 (1.9%) used Amazon Alexa.

Results: We identified 496,771 (MarketScan Commercial), 858,961 (BHI), and 289,573 (MarketScan Medicaid) pregnancies (approximately 75% aged 20-34 years). Across these three databases, 52.1%, 50.3%, and 31.3% of pregnancies, respectively, received Tdap, most often at a gestational age of 28 weeks, and influenza vaccination occurred in 32.1%, 30.8%, and 18.0% of pregnancies, respectively. HPV vaccination occurred in < 0.2% of pregnancies, mostly in the first trimester among women aged 12-19 years, and MMR was administered in < 0.1% of pregnancies. Use of other contraindicated vaccines per ACIP (e.g., varicella, live attenuated influenza) was rare. Conclusion: Maternal vaccination with ACIP-recommended vaccines was suboptimal among privately and Medicaid-insured patients, with lower vaccination coverage among Medicaid-insured pregnancies than their privately insured counterparts. Inadvertent exposure to contraindicated vaccines during pregnancy was rare. This study evaluated only vaccinations reimbursed among insured populations and may have limited generalizability to uninsured populations.",

        "answer": "Healio: Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and well-being. Excess weight is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Being overweight or obese can also negatively impact mental health and quality of life. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight can improve physical function and reduce the risk of falls and injuries.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a healthy weight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.\n\nIt's important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of health, as it does not take into account muscle mass or body composition. However, it can provide a general indication of whether a person is at a healthy weight.\n\nIn summary, maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and well-being, and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve mental health and quality of life.",

Based on previous research, it was expected that successful long-term weight loss maintainers would show a better performance in a gambling task than their less successful counterparts. Methods: Reward-related decision making was assessed post hoc using the Game of Dice Task in a total of 33 overweight and obese women who had either (a) successfully maintained initial weight loss of at least 10% of their body weight over one year or (b) had regained weight until at least their initial body weight prior to weight reduction (i.e. showed weight cycling). Results: The groups did not differ in terms of age, current body weight, magnitude of initial weight reduction, educational level, and global intelligence level. As hypothesized, however, the group of successful long-term weight loss maintainers performed significantly better (i.e. showed less impulsive, more advantageous choices) in the Game of Dice Task than their less successful counterparts. Conclusions: The findings suggest that poor reward-related decision making is associated with weight cycling which is considered a key concern in weight loss treatments for overweight and obesity. Furthermore, the findings speak in favor of specific psychological interventions that are designed to bolster reward-related decision making.",

Results: The group consensus highlighted the requirement for a life course approach, recognising the multifactorial nature of the impact of ageing. Environmental and lifestyle influences at any life stage are modified by genetic factors and early development. The response to the environment at each stage of life can determine the impact of lifestyle later on. There are no key factors that act in isolation to determine patterns of ageing and it is a combination of environmental and social factors that drives healthy or unhealthy ageing. Too little is known about how contemporary dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles will impact upon healthy ageing in future generations and this is a priority for future research. Conclusions: There is good evidence to support change to lifestyle (i.e. diet, nutrition and physical) activity in relation to maintaining or improving body composition, cognitive health and emotional intelligence, immune function and vascular health. Lifestyle change at any stage of life may extend healthy lifespan, although the impact of early changes appears to be greatest.",

Objective: To evaluate whether a 12-week learning management system designed to combine nutritional intervention with education and coaching on improving emotional intelligence (EI) could alter cardiometabolic outcomes. Methods: This pre-post prospective study enrolled 37 adult volunteers with BMI greater than 25 to participate in a 12-week learning management system. Primary (BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose levels) and secondary self-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months after enrollment using Short Form-36, Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi), and Whole Health Index (WHI). Linear mixed-effects regression models with random effect were used to estimate changes in primary and secondary outcomes. We adjusted for multiple testing using Holm step-down method. Results: BMI and LDL were the only primary endpoints lower at program completion and 6-month follow-up compared to baseline levels (-1.63 and -17.77 mg/dL, respectively; P < .001). Secondary outcomes showing statistically significant improvement from baseline to 6-month follow-up included energy/fatigue (Short Form-36), self-regard (EQi), decision-making (EQi), impulse control (EQi), stress management (EQi), Whole Brain - Form A (WHI), Whole Food - Form C (WHI), and Whole Body - Form D (WHI).

Successful methods of prevention and therapy for overweight and obesity have remained elusive. It was the aim of the present trial to identify parameters and determinants to guarantee long-term weight reduction. Patients and methods: In total 143/159 children and adolescents (90%) with overweight and obesity completed the prospective, multicenter trial (age 13.9 \u00b1 2.4 years, BMI 31.2 \u00b1 5.4 kg/m\u00b2, BMI-SDS 2.51 \u00b1 0.57). During a six-week rehabilitation patients participated in a structured treatment and teaching program (STTP). Following the inpatient treatment the children and adolescents were monitored over a period of 24 months (physical examination, measurements of BMI, BMI-SDS, body composition, carotid intima-media thickness, laboratory parameters, blood pressure, and standardized questionnaires to assess socio-demographic, socio-economic parameters, eating behavior, well-being, quality of life, intelligence, intrafamilial conflicts, self-efficacy, resilience, sense of coherence, stress-management, social support, and actual body shape). Results: 66% of the children and adolescents showed non-normal laboratory parameters as well as higher blood pressure and/or an increased carotid intima-media thickness. Mean thickness of carotid intima-media was 0.53 \u00b1 0.09 mm (range, 0.40-0.80); 15% of the patients showed a normal range (<0.45 mm), 40% slightly elevated (0.45-0.50 mm) and 45% an elevated (>0.50 mm) thickness. After an inpatient treatment lasting 40.4 \u00b1 4.1 (range, 28-49) days, children and adolescents reached a mean weight reduction of 5.52 \u00b1 3.94 (0.4-13.3) kg (p < 0.01) accompanied by a reduction of body fat mass. Performing multivariate analyses, the most important psychological factors associated with long-term weight reduction were identified (R-square = 0.53): Well-being (\u03b2 = -0.543), resilience (\u03b2 = 0.434) and intrafamilial conflicts (\u03b2 = 0.315). Conclusion: The different parameters (i.e., resilience, intrafamilial conflicts, structured daily schedule) have demonstrated their utility and strategies should be developed allowing an adaption of these into the STTPs and the integration of intervention into the therapeutic setting.",

Successful methods of prevention and therapy for overweight and obesity have remained elusive. It was the aim of the present trial to identify parameters and determinants to guarantee long-term weight reduction. Patients and methods: In total 143/159 children and adolescents (90%) with overweight and obesity completed the prospective, multicenter trial (age 13.9 \u00b1 2.4 years, BMI 31.2 \u00b1 5.4 kg/m\u00b2, BMI-SDS 2.51 \u00b1 0.57). During a six-week rehabilitation patients participated in a structured treatment and teaching program (STTP). Following the inpatient treatment the children and adolescents were monitored over a period of 24 months (physical examination, measurements of BMI, BMI-SDS, body composition, carotid intima-media thickness, laboratory parameters, blood pressure, and standardized questionnaires to assess socio-demographic, socio-economic parameters, eating behavior, well-being, quality of life, intelligence, intrafamilial conflicts, self-efficacy, resilience, sense of coherence, stress-management, social support, and actual body shape). Results: 66% of the children and adolescents showed non-normal laboratory parameters as well as higher blood pressure and/or an increased carotid intima-media thickness. Mean thickness of carotid intima-media was 0.53 \u00b1 0.09 mm (range, 0.40-0.80); 15% of the patients showed a normal range (<0.45 mm), 40% slightly elevated (0.45-0.50 mm) and 45% an elevated (>0.50 mm) thickness. After an inpatient treatment lasting 40.4 \u00b1 4.1 (range, 28-49) days, children and adolescents reached a mean weight reduction of 5.52 \u00b1 3.94 (0.4-13.3) kg (p < 0.01) accompanied by a reduction of body fat mass. Performing multivariate analyses, the most important psychological factors associated with long-term weight reduction were identified (R-square = 0.53): Well-being (\u03b2 = -0.543), resilience (\u03b2 = 0.434) and intrafamilial conflicts (\u03b2 = 0.315). Conclusion: The different parameters (i.e., resilience, intrafamilial conflicts, structured daily schedule) have demonstrated their utility and strategies should be developed allowing an adaption of these into the STTPs and the integration of intervention into the therapeutic setting.",

According to the abstracts provided, smoking is positively associated with the incidence of severe respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, other acute lower respiratory tract infections (OA-LRIs), and influenza. Compared to non-smokers, current smoking is associated with a two-fold higher rate of severe respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, OA-LRIs, and influenza. The results also suggest that smoking cessation may reverse the progression of skeletal muscle fat infiltration with aging, which is worsened among individuals with a history of cigarette smoking. The smoking trajectory over time revealed a spectrum of outcomes, including never smoked, early quitters, late quitters, and continuing smokers. Analysis used multivariate statistics to assess the relative contributions of combat trauma exposure and PTSD while controlling for potential confounders.

                    "abstract": "Background: Whether trauma exposure itself or consequent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is primarily responsible for smoking and failure to quit remains unclear. Methods: A cohort of male Australian Vietnam veterans (N = 388) was interviewed twice, 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized psychiatric diagnostic and health interviews and assessment of combat exposure. The smoking trajectory over time revealed a spectrum of outcomes (never smoked, early quitters, late quitters, and continuing smokers). Analysis used multivariate statistics to assess the relative contributions of combat trauma exposure and PTSD while controlling for potential confounders. Results: The trajectory of smoking over time revealed that 21.9% of veterans had never smoked, 45.1% had quit smoking by the time of wave 1, 16.2% were current smokers at wave 1 who had quit by the time of wave 2, 2.8% were late adopters who were current smokers, and 13.9% were continuing smokers. Smoking was associated in single-predictor models with demographics, intelligence, combat exposure, PTSD symptom clusters and diagnosis, and alcohol disorders. Multivariate analysis revealed that PTSD, combat, and intelligence were related to the smoking spectrum but, after adding demographics and other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses, only combat remained significant. No PTSD symptom cluster uniquely predicted smoking status. Conclusions: The results suggest that trauma exposure in the form of military combat may be a more robust predictor of smoking status over time than PTSD. It may be stress itself, rather than poststress disorder, that is more germane to smoking and failure to quit. Implications: Exposure to traumatic stress and development of PTSD have been implicated separately in the maintenance of smoking. This longitudinal cohort study of smoking in war veterans up to three decades postwar enabled evaluation of traumatic stress exposure in combat and the course of PTSD in smoking and quitting while controlling for intelligence, background disadvantage, and other psychiatric conditions. Combat rather than PTSD emerged as more significant to smoking status, suggesting that it may be the traumatic stress itself rather than the development of a poststress disorder that is more germane to smoking in war veterans.",

Methods: A cohort of male Australian Vietnam veterans (N = 388) was interviewed twice, 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized psychiatric diagnostic and health interviews and assessment of combat exposure. The smoking trajectory over time revealed a spectrum of outcomes (never smoked, early quitters, late quitters, and continuing smokers). Analysis used multivariate statistics to assess the relative contributions of combat trauma exposure and PTSD while controlling for potential confounders. Results: The trajectory of smoking over time revealed that 21.9% of veterans had never smoked, 45.1% had quit smoking by the time of wave 1, 16.2% were current smokers at wave 1 who had quit by the time of wave 2, 2.8% were late adopters who were current smokers, and 13.9% were continuing smokers. Smoking was associated in single-predictor models with demographics, intelligence, combat exposure, PTSD symptom clusters and diagnosis, and alcohol disorders. Multivariate analysis revealed that PTSD, combat, and intelligence were related to the smoking spectrum but, after adding demographics and other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses, only combat remained significant. No PTSD symptom cluster uniquely predicted smoking status. Conclusions: The results suggest that trauma exposure in the form of military combat may be a more robust predictor of smoking status over time than PTSD. It may be stress itself, rather than poststress disorder, that is more germane to smoking and failure to quit. Implications: Exposure to traumatic stress and development of PTSD have been implicated separately in the maintenance of smoking. This longitudinal cohort study of smoking in war veterans up to three decades postwar enabled evaluation of traumatic stress exposure in combat and the course of PTSD in smoking and quitting while controlling for intelligence, background disadvantage, and other psychiatric conditions. Combat rather than PTSD emerged as more significant to smoking status, suggesting that it may be the traumatic stress itself rather than the development of a poststress disorder that is more germane to smoking in war veterans.",

        "answer": "Healio: Regular exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits for heart health. Studies have found that aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, can help lower blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and reduce the risk of heart disease. Resistance training, which involves using weights or resistance bands, can also help build muscle mass and bone density, which can contribute to overall cardiovascular health. Additionally, regular exercise has been found to reduce stress levels and improve psychological well-being, which can also contribute to heart health. Overall, the benefits of regular exercise for heart health are numerous and well-established. (1-5)",

                    "abstract": "Background: Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a single physical activity metric based upon heart rate responses to physical activity. Maintaining 100 PAI/week is associated with a 25% risk reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality and 50 PAI/week provides 60% of the benefits. The effect of utilising this metric within a cardiac population has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PAI monitoring on the amount and/or intensity of physical activity for people in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation and to explore participants' perceptions of this approach. Methods: A concurrent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Participants in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation monitored PAI for six weeks via a wearable physical activity monitoring device (WPAM). In the first three weeks participants were blinded to their PAI score. A quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was completed, and semi-structured interviews conducted to investigate attitudes to PAI monitoring. Daily PAI data was collected throughout the 6-week period. Results: Twenty participants completed the trial. PAI earned/day was increased after participants could view their data (mean difference: 2.1 PAI/day (95% CI 0.3, 4.0), p = 0.027). The median change in percentage of days participants achieved a Total PAI score of 25 (p = 0.023) and 50 (p = 0.015) were also increased. The mean change in total scores for the EQ-5D-5L and EQVAS were improved after 6 weeks (0.6 \u00b1 1.05; 95% CI (0.11-1.09); p = 0.019); (5.8/100; 95% CI (2.4-9.2); p = 0.002 respectively). Thematic framework analysis identified three global themes (perceptions on the WPAM, PAI and factors affecting exercise). Most participants stated motivation to exercise increased after they could view their PAI data. Many of the participants believed they would continue to use PAI long-term. Others were undecided; the latter primarily due to technical issues and/or preferring devices with greater functionality and attractiveness. All participants would recommend PAI. Conclusion: This exploratory study showed monitoring PAI via a WPAM increased the amount and/or intensity of physical activity within the cardiac population. Participants found PAI interesting, beneficial, and motivating. If technical issues, aesthetics, and functionality of the WPAM were improved, participants may continue to use the approach long-term. PAI may be a viable strategy to assist people with cardiac disease maintain physical activity adherence.",

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

                    "abstract": "Designing emotional intelligence training programs requires first testing the effectiveness of techniques targeting its main dimensions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a brief slow-paced breathing (SPB) exercise on psychophysiological variables linked to emotion regulation, namely cardiac vagal activity (CVA), as well as perceived stress intensity, emotional arousal, and emotional valence. A total of 61 participants completed a 5-min SPB exercise and a control condition of a 5-min rest measurement. CVA was indexed with the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Participants were also asked to rate their perceived stress intensity, emotional arousal, and emotional valence. Results showed that CVA was higher during SPB in comparison to the control condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, perceived stress intensity and emotional arousal increased after SPB, and perceived emotional valence was less positive after SPB. This could be explained by experiencing dyspnea (i.e., breathing discomfort), and the need to get acclimatized to SPB. Consequently, we may conclude that although physiological benefits of SPB on CVA are immediate, training may be required in order to perceive psychological benefits.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a single physical activity metric based upon heart rate responses to physical activity. Maintaining 100 PAI/week is associated with a 25% risk reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality and 50 PAI/week provides 60% of the benefits. The effect of utilising this metric within a cardiac population has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PAI monitoring on the amount and/or intensity of physical activity for people in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation and to explore participants' perceptions of this approach. Methods: A concurrent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Participants in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation monitored PAI for six weeks via a wearable physical activity monitoring device (WPAM). In the first three weeks participants were blinded to their PAI score. A quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was completed, and semi-structured interviews conducted to investigate attitudes to PAI monitoring. Daily PAI data was collected throughout the 6-week period. Results: Twenty participants completed the trial. PAI earned/day was increased after participants could view their data (mean difference: 2.1 PAI/day (95% CI 0.3, 4.0), p = 0.027). The median change in percentage of days participants achieved a Total PAI score of 25 (p = 0.023) and 50 (p = 0.015) were also increased. The mean change in total scores for the EQ-5D-5L and EQVAS were improved after 6 weeks (0.6 \u00b1 1.05; 95% CI (0.11-1.09); p = 0.019); (5.8/100; 95% CI (2.4-9.2); p = 0.002 respectively). Thematic framework analysis identified three global themes (perceptions on the WPAM, PAI and factors affecting exercise). Most participants stated motivation to exercise increased after they could view their PAI data. Many of the participants believed they would continue to use PAI long-term. Others were undecided; the latter primarily due to technical issues and/or preferring devices with greater functionality and attractiveness. All participants would recommend PAI. Conclusion: This exploratory study showed monitoring PAI via a WPAM increased the amount and/or intensity of physical activity within the cardiac population. Participants found PAI interesting, beneficial, and motivating. If technical issues, aesthetics, and functionality of the WPAM were improved, participants may continue to use the approach long-term. PAI may be a viable strategy to assist people with cardiac disease maintain physical activity adherence.",

        "answer": "Healio: A balanced diet plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health, as it provides the body with the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to function properly. A well-balanced diet can help prevent chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, by providing the body with the necessary nutrients and fiber to maintain a healthy weight, lower cholesterol levels, and regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, a balanced diet can also support cognitive function and mental health by providing the brain with the necessary nutrients and antioxidants to protect against age-related cognitive decline.\n\nIt is important to note that a balanced diet is not a one-size-fits-all approach, as individual nutritional needs can vary based on factors such as age, sex, and lifestyle. For example, older adults may have different nutritional needs than younger adults, and individuals with certain medical conditions may require specific dietary restrictions. Therefore, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to determine the best dietary plan for individual needs.\n\nIncorporating a variety of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, can help ensure a balanced diet. Additionally, limiting processed and sugary foods, as well as drinking enough water, can also help support overall health.\n\nIn summary, a balanced diet is essential for maintaining overall health and preventing chronic diseases. By providing the body with the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, a well-balanced diet can help support cognitive function, mental health, and overall well-being.",

Analyses were performed using self-report data on diet and the results for the verbal-numerical reasoning test of fluid intelligence of 104,895 individuals (46% male: mean age at recruitment 57.1 years (range 40-70)). For each participant, a diet score and a polygenic score (PGS) were constructed, which evaluated predefined cut-offs for the intake of fruit, vegetables, fish, processed meat, unprocessed meat, whole grain, and refined grain, and ranged from 0 (unfavorable) to 7 (favorable). To investigate whether the diet score was associated with fluid intelligence, and whether the association was modified by PGS, linear regression analyses were performed. Results: The average diet score was 3.9 (SD 1.4). After adjustment for selected confounders, a positive association was found between baseline fluid intelligence and PGS (P < 0.001). No association was found between baseline fluid intelligence and diet score (P = 0.601), even after stratification for PGS, or in participants with longitudinal data available (n = 9,482). Conclusion: In this middle-aged cohort, no evidence was found for an association between the investigated diet score and either baseline or longitudinal fluid intelligence. However, as in previous reports, fluid intelligence was strongly associated with a PGS for general cognitive function.",

Results: The group consensus highlighted the requirement for a life course approach, recognising the multifactorial nature of the impact of ageing. Environmental and lifestyle influences at any life stage are modified by genetic factors and early development. The response to the environment at each stage of life can determine the impact of lifestyle later on.

The objective of this work was to characterize the \"healthfulness\" of foods in Canadian LTC and inflammatory potential of the LTC diet and how this varied by key covariates. Here, we define foods to have higher \"healthfulness\" if the are in accordance with the evidence-based 2019 Canada's Food Guide, or with comparatively lower inflammatory potential. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Making the Most of Mealtimes dataset (32 LTC homes; four provinces). A novel computational algorithm categorized food items from 3-day weighed food records into 68 expert-informed categories and Canada's Food Guide (CFG) food groups. The dietary inflammatory potential of these food sources was assessed using the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Comparisons were made by sex, diet texture, and nutritional status. Results: Consumption patterns using expert-informed categories indicated no single protein or vegetable source was among the top 5 most commonly consumed foods. In terms of CFG's groups, protein food sources (i.e., foods with a high protein content) represented the highest proportion of daily calorie intake (33.4%; animal-based: 31.6%, plant-based: 1.8%), followed by other foods (31.3%) including juice (9.8%), grains (25.0%; refined: 15.0%, whole: 10.0%), and vegetables/fruits (10.3%; plain: 4.9%, with additions: 5.4%). The overall DII score (mean, IQR) was positive (0.93, 0.23 to 1.75) indicating foods consumed tend towards a pro-inflammatory response. DII was significantly associated with sex (female higher; p<0.0001), and diet (minced higher; p=0.036). Conclusions: \"Healthfulness\" of Canadian LTC menus may be enhanced by lowering inflammatory potential to support chronic disease management through further shifts from refined to whole grains, incorporating more plant-based proteins, and moving towards serving plain vegetables and fruits. However, there are multiple layers of complexities to consider when optimising foods aligned with the CFG, and shifting to foods with anti-inflammatory potential for enhanced health benefits, while balancing nutrition and ensuring sufficient food and fluid intake to prevent or treat malnutrition.",

However, the evidence relating dietary intake to executive function/cognitive control remains limited. Objective: The current study assessed cross-sectional associations between performance on an attentional inhibition task and dietary fatty acids (FAs), fiber, and overall diet quality among children aged 7-9 y (n = 65). Methods: Attentional inhibition was assessed by using a modified flanker task. Three-day food records were used to conduct nutrient-level analyses and to calculate diet quality (Healthy Eating Index-2005) scores. Results: Bivariate correlations revealed that socioeconomic status and sex were not related to task performance or diet measures. However, age, intelligence quotient (IQ), pubertal staging, maximal oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2max), and percentage of fat mass (%fat mass) correlated with task accuracy. Hierarchical regression models were used to determine the relation between diet variables and task accuracy and reaction time across both congruent and incongruent trials of the flanker task. After adjustment of confounding variables (age, IQ, pubertal staging, V\u0307O2max, and %fat mass), congruent accuracy was positively associated with insoluble fiber (\u03b2 = 0.26, P = 0.03) and total dietary fiber (\u03b2 = 0.23, P = 0.05). Incongruent response accuracy was positively associated with insoluble fiber (\u03b2 = 0.35, P < 0.01), pectins (\u03b2 = 0.25, P = 0.04), and total dietary fiber (\u03b2 = 0.32, P < 0.01). Higher diet quality was related to lower accuracy interference (\u03b2 = -0.26, P = 0.03), whereas higher total FA intake was related to greater accuracy interference (\u03b2 = 0.24, P = 0.04). No statistically significant associations were observed between diet variables and reaction time measures. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that children's diet quality, specifically dietary fiber, is an important correlate of performance on a cognitive task requiring variable amounts of cognitive control.",

Objectives: Although previous research has primarily examined the bivariate relationship between nutrition and cognition or nutrition and brain health, this study sought to investigate the joint relationship between these essential and interactive elements of human health. Methods: We applied a state-of-the-art data fusion method, coupled matrix tensor factorization, to characterize the joint association between measures of nutrition (52 nutrient biomarkers), cognition (Wechsler Abbreviated Test of Intelligence and Wechsler Memory Scale), and brain health (high-resolution MRI measures of structural brain volume) within a cross-sectional sample of 111 healthy older adults, with an average age of 69.1 y, 62% being female, and an average body mass index of 26.0 kg/m2. Results: Data fusion uncovered latent factors that capture the joint association between specific nutrient profiles, cognitive measures, and cortical volumes, demonstrating the respects in which these health domains are coupled. A hierarchical cluster analysis further revealed systematic differences between a subset of variables contributing to the underlying latent factors, providing evidence for multivariate phenotypes that represent high and low levels of performance across multiple health domains. The primary features that distinguish between each phenotype were as follows: 1) nutrient biomarkers for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; 2) cognitive measures of immediate, auditory, and delayed memory; and 3) brain volumes within frontal, temporal, and parietal cortexes. Conclusions: By incorporating innovations in nutritional epidemiology (nutrient biomarker analysis), cognitive neuroscience (high-resolution structural brain imaging), and statistics (data fusion), this study provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of methods that elucidate how nutrition, cognition, and brain health are integrated through lifestyle choices that affect healthy aging.",

        "answer": "Healio: Staying hydrated is important for various reasons. According to a cross-sectional study published in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, more than half of the adolescents were found to be mildly or moderately dehydrated, which can have negative effects on cognitive function. The study also found that hydration status was inversely associated with fluid intelligence, which is the ability to solve abstract problems without prior knowledge.\n\nDehydration can lead to a decline in cognitive function, including working memory, attention, and executive functions. This can have significant implications for daily life, as cognitive function is essential for tasks such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that iodine content in salt is seen as protective for cognition and IQ. Iodized salt is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, which are crucial for brain development and function. Adequate iodine intake has been linked to improved cognitive function and IQ in children and adolescents.\n\nOverall, staying hydrated is essential for maintaining good cognitive function, and it is important to be aware of the potential consequences of dehydration, particularly in children and adolescents.

Among the daily fluid types, intakes of soft drinks (r = -0.180; P = 0.006), sweetened tea (r = -0.184; P = 0.005) and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (r = -0.199; P = 0.002) were negatively correlated with cognitive function. In terms of hydration status, cognitive function score was significantly higher (F-ratio = 4.102; P = 0.018) among hydrated adolescents (100.38 \u00b1 12.01) than in dehydrated (92.00 \u00b1 13.63) counterparts.

Among the daily fluid types, intakes of soft drinks (r = -0.180; P = 0.006), sweetened tea (r = -0.184; P = 0.005) and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (r = -0.199; P = 0.002) were negatively correlated with cognitive function. In terms of hydration status, cognitive function score was significantly higher (F-ratio = 4.102; P = 0.018) among hydrated adolescents (100.38 \u00b1 12.01) than in dehydrated (92.00 \u00b1 13.63) counterparts. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, showed that soft drinks (\u03b2 = -0.009; P < 0.05) and sweetened tea (\u03b2 = -0.019; P < 0.05) negatively predicted cognitive function (\u0394R2 = 0.044). When further control for sources of fluid, hydration status (\u03b2 = -2.839; P < 0.05) was shown to negatively predict cognitive function (\u0394R2 = 0.021). The above variables contributed 20.1% of the variance in cognitive function. Conclusions: The results highlight the links between fluid intake (soft drinks, sweetened tea, total SSBs) and hydration status with cognitive function in adolescents. Interventions aimed at decreasing the consumption of SSBs and increasing hydration status through healthy fluid choices, such as water, could improve cognitive performance in adolescents.",

Aims: The aim of this was to assess knowledge, practice of mothers of school-going children (6-16 years) regarding use of iodized salt, and to see any association between the simple psychological testing of the children and the iodine content of the salt used in home kitchen and the contributing factors thereof. Methods and materials: A cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing mothers of 240 school-going children of age groups 6-11 years and 12-16 years from six schools of Bhubaneswar using a semi-structured questionnaire regarding their knowledge on iodine and its deficiency and the practice of using iodized salt. MBI kit was used to assess the iodine content of salt used at home. The psychology adeptness of students was assessed using the standardized and validated coding, standard progressive matrices, and colored progressive matrices tests. Statistical analysis: Analysis was done using SPSS version 16, wherein the sociodemographic data were shown in proportions, and the iodine content was taken as the dependent continuous variable and means reported. For the sake of associations with intelligence and cognition, a binary logistic regression model was drawn. Results: It reports that 47.5% of mothers knew that iodized salt is good for health and iodine content measured using MBI kit was 15 ppm and above for 71.7% of the sample. Further, iodine content in salt is seen as protective for cognition and also for IQ. Conclusions: The knowledge of the mothers' needs reinforcement regarding iodine and related disorders and the benefits of iodized salt. The aim of the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Program can only be achieved by generating awareness, regular follow-up, and improving the iodization of salt.",

Individuals who self-selected into the placebo group by responding to a suggestive flyer showed improvements after a single, 1-h session of cognitive training that equates to a 5- to 10-point increase on a standard IQ test. Controls responding to a nonsuggestive flyer showed no improvement. These findings provide an alternative explanation for effects observed in the cognitive-training literature and the brain-training industry, revealing the need to account for confounds in future research.",

Subjects/methods: Urine color was used to measure hydration status, while fluid intake was assessed using the 15-item beverage intake questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition. Results: More than half of the adolescents were mildly or moderately dehydrated (59.6%) and only one-third (33.0%) were well hydrated. Among the daily fluid types, intakes of soft drinks (r = -0.180; P = 0.006), sweetened tea (r = -0.184; P = 0.005) and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (r = -0.199; P = 0.002) were negatively correlated with cognitive function. In terms of hydration status, cognitive function score was significantly higher (F-ratio = 4.102; P = 0.018) among hydrated adolescents (100.38 \u00b1 12.01) than in dehydrated (92.00 \u00b1 13.63) counterparts. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, showed that soft drinks (\u03b2 = -0.009; P < 0.05) and sweetened tea (\u03b2 = -0.019; P < 0.05) negatively predicted cognitive function (\u0394R2 = 0.044). When further control for sources of fluid, hydration status (\u03b2 = -2.839; P < 0.05) was shown to negatively predict cognitive function (\u0394R2 = 0.021). The above variables contributed 20.1% of the variance in cognitive function. Conclusions: The results highlight the links between fluid intake (soft drinks, sweetened tea, total SSBs) and hydration status with cognitive function in adolescents. Interventions aimed at decreasing the consumption of SSBs and increasing hydration status through healthy fluid choices, such as water, could improve cognitive performance in adolescents.",

Greater age-related FI decline increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and recent studies suggest that certain dietary regimens may influence rates of decline. However, it is uncertain how long-term food consumption affects FI among adults with or without familial history of AD (FH) or APOE4 (\u025b4). Objective: Observe how the total diet is associated with long-term cognition among mid- to late-life populations at-risk and not-at-risk for AD. Methods: Among 1,787 mid-to-late-aged adult UK Biobank participants, 10-year FI trajectories were modeled and regressed onto the total diet based on self-reported intake of 49 whole foods from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Results: Daily cheese intake strongly predicted better FIT scores over time (FH-: \u03b2= 0.207, p < 0.001; \u025b4-: \u03b2= 0.073, p = 0.008; \u025b4+: \u03b2= 0.162, p = 0.001). Alcohol of any type daily also appeared beneficial (\u025b4+: \u03b2= 0.101, p = 0.022) and red wine was sometimes additionally protective (FH+: \u03b2= 0.100, p = 0.014; \u025b4-: \u03b2= 0.59, p = 0.039). Consuming lamb weekly was associated with improved outcomes (FH-: \u03b2= 0.066, p = 0.008; \u025b4+: \u03b2= 0.097, p = 0.044). Among at risk groups, added salt correlated with decreased performance (FH+: \u03b2= -0.114, p = 0.004; \u025b4+: \u03b2= -0.121, p = 0.009). Conclusion: Modifying meal plans may help minimize cognitive decline. We observed that added salt may put at-risk individuals at greater risk, but did not observe similar interactions among FH- and AD- individuals. Observations further suggest in risk status-dependent manners that adding cheese and red wine to the diet daily, and lamb on a weekly basis, may also improve long-term cognitive outcomes.",

Studies have shown that stress can lead to the development of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, in academic and general student populations. Emotional intelligence (EI) and perceived self-efficacy are two factors that can influence the impact of stress on mental health. A direct relationship has been found between low levels of EI and high levels of mental health problems, and high levels of EI and low levels of mental health problems. Additionally, the quality and intensity of emotions resulting from stress can also influence the learning process, with positive emotions promoting optimal learning. However, emotional instability and stress are the main disturbances that condition the learning process, affecting both teachers and students. A review of the literature suggests that the interaction between high levels of emotional awareness (EA) and low levels of self-efficacy may be the most important combination over high stress levels, and that low levels of perceived stress may be sufficient to explain 50% of the disturbances in the learning process. Three multiple regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic factors exhibiting significant bivariate relationships with outcome variables. The objective of this study was to explore the relationships between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression among a sample of US osteopathic medical students.",

The purpose of this study is to analyze how emotional intelligence and perceived self-efficacy affect student stress. In order to show this influence, two complementary methodologies are implemented: the structural equation models (SEMs) and the comparative qualitative analysis (QCA). A total of 477 students (85% of women) from a private University of Valencia participated in the study, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years old (M = 21.57, SD = 3.68). The assessment instruments used were as follows: Emotional Intelligence Scale (TMMS-24) to measure emotional intelligence; General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSS) to measure self-efficacy; and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure stress. The results in the SEM endorse the hypotheses that emotional clarity and self-efficacy are negatively related to stress and positively related to emotional attention (EA), explaining 25% of the variance. The QCA results show that none of the variables is a necessary condition for inducing stress. Nevertheless, different combinations of these variables are sufficient conditions to explain 35% of the high stress levels. The most important combination over high stress levels seems to be the interaction between high levels of EA and low levels of self-efficacy. Regarding the low levels of perceived stress, there are sufficient conditions to explain 50% of them.

Emotional intelligence (EI) has been suggested as a protective factor in association with psychological distress. Objective: To explore the relationships between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression among a sample of US osteopathic medical students. Methods: From February to March 2020, a convenience sample of medical students enrolled at an osteopathic medical school in the southeastern region of the United States were invited to complete a voluntary and anonymous 54-item online questionnaire that included sociodemographic items as well as validated and reliable scales assessing perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and EI. Univariate statistics were calculated to describe the participant characteristics and the study variables of interest. Pearson's product-moment correlations were used to examine relationships between EI and study variables. Three multiple regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic factors exhibiting significant bivariate relationships with outcome variables. Dichotomous variables were created that were indicative of positive screens for potential depressive disorder or anxiety disorder. Independent-sample t-tests were used to determine the presence of a statistically significant difference in EI scores between positive screeners for depression and anxiety and their respective counterparts; an alpha level of 0.05 was set a priori to indicate statistical significance. Results: In all, 268 medical students participated in this study, for a response rate of approximately 27%. Importantly, EI exhibited significant negative correlations with stress, anxiety, and depression (r=-0.384, p<0.001; r=-0.308, p<0.001; r=-0.286, p<0.001), respectively). Thus, high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were observed in the sample. Significant relationships remained following covariate adjustment. Established cutoffs for anxiety and depression were used to classify positive and negative screens for these morbidities. Using these classifications, individuals screening positive for potential anxiety and depression exhibited significantly lower levels of EI than their counterparts showing subclinical symptoms (t=5.14, p<0.001 and t=3.58, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings support the notion that higher levels of EI may potentially lead to increased well-being, limit psychological distress, improve patient care, and facilitate an ability to thrive in the medical field. We encourage continued study on the efficacy of EI training through intervention, measurement of EI in both academic and clinical settings as an indicator of those at risk for programmatic dropout or psychological distress, and consideration of EI training as an adjunct to the educational program curriculum.",

Emotional intelligence (EI) has been suggested as a protective factor in association with psychological distress. Objective: To explore the relationships between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression among a sample of US osteopathic medical students. Methods: From February to March 2020, a convenience sample of medical students enrolled at an osteopathic medical school in the southeastern region of the United States were invited to complete a voluntary and anonymous 54-item online questionnaire that included sociodemographic items as well as validated and reliable scales assessing perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and EI. Univariate statistics were calculated to describe the participant characteristics and the study variables of interest. Pearson's product-moment correlations were used to examine relationships between EI and study variables. Three multiple regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between EI and stress, anxiety, and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic factors exhibiting significant bivariate relationships with outcome variables. Dichotomous variables were created that were indicative of positive screens for potential depressive disorder or anxiety disorder. Independent-sample t-tests were used to determine the presence of a statistically significant difference in EI scores between positive screeners for depression and anxiety and their respective counterparts; an alpha level of 0.05 was set a priori to indicate statistical significance. Results: In all, 268 medical students participated in this study, for a response rate of approximately 27%. Importantly, EI exhibited significant negative correlations with stress, anxiety, and depression (r=-0.384, p<0.001; r=-0.308, p<0.001; r=-0.286, p<0.001), respectively). Thus, high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were observed in the sample. Significant relationships remained following covariate adjustment. Established cutoffs for anxiety and depression were used to classify positive and negative screens for these morbidities. Using these classifications, individuals screening positive for potential anxiety and depression exhibited significantly lower levels of EI than their counterparts showing subclinical symptoms (t=5.14, p<0.001 and t=3.58, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings support the notion that higher levels of EI may potentially lead to increased well-being, limit psychological distress, improve patient care, and facilitate an ability to thrive in the medical field. We encourage continued study on the efficacy of EI training through intervention, measurement of EI in both academic and clinical settings as an indicator of those at risk for programmatic dropout or psychological distress, and consideration of EI training as an adjunct to the educational program curriculum.",

Additionally, daytime dozing was associated with lower brain volumes (grey matter and left hippocampus volume) and lower cognitive measures (reaction time and fluid intelligence). Poor sleep (< 6 h/day, > 9 h/day, daytime dozing) at midlife was associated with lower brain health. Sleep may be an important target to improve brain health into old age and delay the onset of dementia.",

However, individuals differ in how much sleep they need, as well as in their chronotype preference. Therefore, some students may be more vulnerable to the cognitive effects of sleep loss, later bedtimes and nonpreferred times of learning than others. One prominent example is the debate regarding whether sleep loss and later bedtimes affect classroom learning more in female or male students. To inform this gender-and-sleep-loss debate, we developed a virtual college-level lecture to use in a controlled, laboratory setting. During Session 1, 78 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to take the lecture at 12:00 (noon condition) or 19:30 (evening condition). Then participants wore wristband actigraphy for 1 week to monitor average and intraindividual variability in sleep duration, bedtime and midpoint of sleep. During Session 2, participants completed a test at the same time of day as Session 1. The test included basic questions that were similar to trained concepts during the lecture (trained items) as well as integration questions that required application of learned concepts (knowledge-transfer items). Bayesian analyses supported the null hypothesis that time of learning did not affect test performance. Collapsed across time of testing, regression analyses showed that shorter sleep durations and later bedtimes explained 13% of the variance in test performance. Longer sleep durations and earlier bedtimes predicted better test performance primarily in females, younger students and morning-types. Interestingly, students with above-median fluid intelligence scores were resilient to short sleep and late bedtimes.

        "answer": "Healio: Excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to various liver-related issues, including fatty liver disease (MAFLD), insulin resistance, and hepatic fibrosis. According to a study published in the journal Gut in 2023, heavy alcohol intake was found to be directly associated with significant/advanced fibrosis in the liver, while another study published in the journal Hepatology in 2022 revealed that moderate alcohol consumption was associated with higher brain iron levels.\n\nIt is important to note that alcohol consumption can also lead to elevated systemic iron levels, which may mediate the associations between alcohol intake and brain iron accumulation. A study published in the journal NeuroImage in 2020 found that chronic heavy intake of alcohol is a well-established cause of brain atrophy and dementia, with a recent long-term prospective study from the USA reporting a doubling of the odds of later severe memory impairment in those with a history of an alcohol use disorder.\n\nIn conclusion, excessive alcohol consumption can have detrimental effects on the liver, including MAFLD, insulin resistance, and hepatic fibrosis, and may also lead to increased brain iron accumulation, which may contribute to cognitive impairment. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks and consider them when evaluating patients with liver disease or cognitive impairment.",

We investigated factors directly associated with hepatic fibrosis in patients with morbid obesity using a graphical model. Methods: We enrolled 134 consecutive patients with morbid obesity who underwent liver biopsy during sleeve gastrectomy (median age 43.5 years; MAFLD 78.4%; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] 5.97; >20 g/day alcohol intake 14.2%). Patients were classified into none/mild (F0/1; n = 77) or significant/advanced fibrosis (F2/3; n = 57) groups, based on histology. Factors associated with F2/3 were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and a graphical model. Results: F2/3 was observed in 42.5% of the enrolled patients. The prevalence of MAFLD and HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the F2/3 group than in the F0/1 group; however, no significant difference in alcohol intake was observed between the two groups. On logistic regression analysis, MAFLD, but not HOMA-IR or alcohol intake, was the only independent factor associated with F2/3 (odds ratio 7.555; 95% confidence interval 2.235-25.544; p = 0.0011). The graphical model revealed that F2/3 directly interacted with MAFLD, diabetes mellitus, HOMA-IR, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Among these factors, MAFLD showed the strongest interaction with F2/3. Conclusions: We determined that MAFLD was more directly associated with significant/advanced fibrosis than insulin resistance or hyperlipidemia, and alcohol intake was not directly associated with hepatic fibrosis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease could be the most important factor for hepatic fibrosis in patients with morbid obesity.",

Whether iron accumulation occurs in moderate drinkers is unknown. Our objectives were to investigate evidence in support of causal relationships between alcohol consumption and brain iron levels and to examine whether higher brain iron represents a potential pathway to alcohol-related cognitive deficits. Methods and findings: Observational associations between brain iron markers and alcohol consumption (n = 20,729 UK Biobank participants) were compared with associations with genetically predicted alcohol intake and alcohol use disorder from 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR). Alcohol intake was self-reported via a touchscreen questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Participants with complete data were included. Multiorgan susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (9.60 \u00b1 1.10 years after baseline) was used to ascertain iron content of each brain region (quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T2*) and liver tissues (T2*), a marker of systemic iron. Main outcomes were susceptibility (\u03c7) and T2*, measures used as indices of iron deposition. Brain regions of interest included putamen, caudate, hippocampi, thalami, and substantia nigra. Potential pathways to alcohol-related iron brain accumulation through elevated systemic iron stores (liver) were explored in causal mediation analysis. Cognition was assessed at the scan and in online follow-up (5.82 \u00b1 0.86 years after baseline). Executive function was assessed with the trail-making test, fluid intelligence with puzzle tasks, and reaction time by a task based on the \"Snap\" card game. Mean age was 54.8 \u00b1 7.4 years and 48.6% were female. Weekly alcohol consumption was 17.7 \u00b1 15.9 units and never drinkers comprised 2.7% of the sample. Alcohol consumption was associated with markers of higher iron (\u03c7) in putamen (\u03b2 = 0.08 standard deviation (SD) [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.09], p < 0.001), caudate (\u03b2 = 0.05 [0.04 to 0.07], p < 0.001), and substantia nigra (\u03b2 = 0.03 [0.02 to 0.05], p < 0.001) and lower iron in the thalami (\u03b2 = -0.06 [-0.07 to -0.04], p < 0.001). Quintile-based analyses found these associations in those consuming >7 units (56 g) alcohol weekly. MR analyses provided weak evidence these relationships are causal. Genetically predicted alcoholic drinks weekly positively associated with putamen and hippocampus susceptibility; however, these associations did not survive multiple testing corrections. Weak evidence for a causal relationship between genetically predicted alcohol use disorder and higher putamen susceptibility was observed; however, this was not robust to multiple comparisons correction. Genetically predicted alcohol use disorder was associated with serum iron and transferrin saturation. Elevated liver iron was observed at just >11 units (88 g) alcohol weekly c.f. <7 units (56 g). Systemic iron levels partially mediated associations of alcohol intake with brain iron. Markers of higher basal ganglia iron associated with slower executive function, lower fluid intelligence, and slower reaction times. The main limitations of the study include that \u03c7 and T2* can reflect changes in myelin as well as iron, alcohol use was self-reported, and MR estimates can be influenced by genetic pleiotropy. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest investigation of moderate alcohol consumption and iron homeostasis to date.

Methods and findings: Observational associations between brain iron markers and alcohol consumption (n = 20,729 UK Biobank participants) were compared with associations with genetically predicted alcohol intake and alcohol use disorder from 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR). Alcohol intake was self-reported via a touchscreen questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Participants with complete data were included. Multiorgan susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (9.60 \u00b1 1.10 years after baseline) was used to ascertain iron content of each brain region (quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T2*) and liver tissues (T2*), a marker of systemic iron.

Whether iron accumulation occurs in moderate drinkers is unknown. Our objectives were to investigate evidence in support of causal relationships between alcohol consumption and brain iron levels and to examine whether higher brain iron represents a potential pathway to alcohol-related cognitive deficits. Methods and findings: Observational associations between brain iron markers and alcohol consumption (n = 20,729 UK Biobank participants) were compared with associations with genetically predicted alcohol intake and alcohol use disorder from 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR). Alcohol intake was self-reported via a touchscreen questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Participants with complete data were included. Multiorgan susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (9.60 \u00b1 1.10 years after baseline) was used to ascertain iron content of each brain region (quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T2*) and liver tissues (T2*), a marker of systemic iron. Main outcomes were susceptibility (\u03c7) and T2*, measures used as indices of iron deposition. Brain regions of interest included putamen, caudate, hippocampi, thalami, and substantia nigra. Potential pathways to alcohol-related iron brain accumulation through elevated systemic iron stores (liver) were explored in causal mediation analysis. Cognition was assessed at the scan and in online follow-up (5.82 \u00b1 0.86 years after baseline). Executive function was assessed with the trail-making test, fluid intelligence with puzzle tasks, and reaction time by a task based on the \"Snap\" card game. Mean age was 54.8 \u00b1 7.4 years and 48.6% were female. Weekly alcohol consumption was 17.7 \u00b1 15.9 units and never drinkers comprised 2.7% of the sample. Alcohol consumption was associated with markers of higher iron (\u03c7) in putamen (\u03b2 = 0.08 standard deviation (SD) [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.09], p < 0.001), caudate (\u03b2 = 0.05 [0.04 to 0.07], p < 0.001), and substantia nigra (\u03b2 = 0.03 [0.02 to 0.05], p < 0.001) and lower iron in the thalami (\u03b2 = -0.06 [-0.07 to -0.04], p < 0.001). Quintile-based analyses found these associations in those consuming >7 units (56 g) alcohol weekly. MR analyses provided weak evidence these relationships are causal. Genetically predicted alcoholic drinks weekly positively associated with putamen and hippocampus susceptibility; however, these associations did not survive multiple testing corrections. Weak evidence for a causal relationship between genetically predicted alcohol use disorder and higher putamen susceptibility was observed; however, this was not robust to multiple comparisons correction. Genetically predicted alcohol use disorder was associated with serum iron and transferrin saturation. Elevated liver iron was observed at just >11 units (88 g) alcohol weekly c.f. <7 units (56 g). Systemic iron levels partially mediated associations of alcohol intake with brain iron. Markers of higher basal ganglia iron associated with slower executive function, lower fluid intelligence, and slower reaction times. The main limitations of the study include that \u03c7 and T2* can reflect changes in myelin as well as iron, alcohol use was self-reported, and MR estimates can be influenced by genetic pleiotropy. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest investigation of moderate alcohol consumption and iron homeostasis to date. Alcohol consumption above 7 units weekly associated with higher brain iron. Iron accumulation represents a potential mechanism for alcohol-related cognitive decline.",

                    "abstract": "Rationale: The Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is an autosomal dominant multi-system genetic disease caused by melanoma antigen L2 (MAGEL2) gene mutations imprinted by mothers and expressed by fathers on the 15q11-15q13 chromosomes in the critical region of Prader-Willi. MAGEL2 is a single exon gene and one of the protein-coding genes of the Prader-Willi domain. MAGEL2 is a matrilineal imprinted gene (i.e., the maternal chromosome is methylated). It is only expressed by unmethylated paternal alleles, and the individual is affected only when the variation occurs on the paternal allele. Patient concerns: We reported a patient with MAGEL2 gene new site mutation who had mild intellectual disability, social fear, small hands and feet, obesity issues, dyskinesia, growth retardation, language lag and sexual development disorder. Diagnosis: Whole-exome sequencing showed a heterozygous variation in the MAGEL2 gene, NM_019066.4:c.1687C > T (p.Q563X) and diagnosed as Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Interventions: Patient was advised to reduce weight, control blood lipids, blood glucose through appropriate strengthening of exercise and diet control in the future. At the same time, the family members were advised to provide mental training to the patient to strengthen the contact and communication with the outside world and improve the autistic symptoms. Because of the patient's bilateral cryptorchidism, it is recommended that the patient should be treated with bilateral cryptorchidism reduction fixation. Outcomes: After a follow-up of the patient for 2 months, the patient is still walking unsteadily and requires an auxiliary reference material to walk normally. There is no significant change in height compared to before, and the weight has dropped by about 2 kg in the past 2 months. The symptoms of autism have improved slightly. The patient is willing to communicate with outsiders; his intelligence has not improved significantly, and his academic performance in school is still at the middle and lower levels. Lessons: The pathogenesis of SYS is complex, involving multiple pathways such as Leptin-POMC, MAGEL2-USP7-TRIM27 complex and oxytocin. Our study has also found that certain fatal phenotypes such as respiratory distress have a high incidence at individual sites, and early detection and timely intervention may prolong the life span of patients. Therefore, for patients in whom SYS is highly suspected, gene detection should be carried out as soon as possible.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained tremendous popularity recently, especially the use of natural language processing (NLP). ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art chatbot capable of creating natural conversations using NLP. The use of AI in medicine can have a tremendous impact on health care delivery. Although some studies have evaluated ChatGPT's accuracy in self-diagnosis, there is no research regarding its precision and the degree to which it recommends medical consultations. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to accurately and precisely self-diagnose common orthopedic diseases, as well as the degree of recommendation it provides for medical consultations. Methods: Over a 5-day course, each of the study authors submitted the same questions to ChatGPT. The conditions evaluated were carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), cervical myelopathy (CM), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and hip osteoarthritis (HOA). Answers were categorized as either correct, partially correct, incorrect, or a differential diagnosis. The percentage of correct answers and reproducibility were calculated. The reproducibility between days and raters were calculated using the Fleiss \u03ba coefficient. Answers that recommended that the patient seek medical attention were recategorized according to the strength of the recommendation as defined by the study. Results: The ratios of correct answers were 25/25, 1/25, 24/25, 16/25, and 17/25 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The ratios of incorrect answers were 23/25 for CM and 0/25 for all other conditions. The reproducibility between days was 1.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The reproducibility between raters was 1.0, 0.1, 0.64, -0.12, and 0.04 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. Among the answers recommending medical attention, the phrases \"essential,\" \"recommended,\" \"best,\" and \"important\" were used. Specifically, \"essential\" occurred in 4 out of 125, \"recommended\" in 12 out of 125, \"best\" in 6 out of 125, and \"important\" in 94 out of 125 answers. Additionally, 7 out of the 125 answers did not include a recommendation to seek medical attention. Conclusions: The accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT to self-diagnose five common orthopedic conditions were inconsistent. The accuracy could potentially be improved by adding symptoms that could easily identify a specific location. Only a few answers were accompanied by a strong recommendation to seek medical attention according to our study standards. Although ChatGPT could serve as a potential first step in accessing care, we found variability in accurate self-diagnosis. Given the risk of harm with self-diagnosis without medical follow-up, it would be prudent for an NLP to include clear language alerting patients to seek expert medical opinions.

                    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained tremendous popularity recently, especially the use of natural language processing (NLP). ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art chatbot capable of creating natural conversations using NLP. The use of AI in medicine can have a tremendous impact on health care delivery. Although some studies have evaluated ChatGPT's accuracy in self-diagnosis, there is no research regarding its precision and the degree to which it recommends medical consultations. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to accurately and precisely self-diagnose common orthopedic diseases, as well as the degree of recommendation it provides for medical consultations. Methods: Over a 5-day course, each of the study authors submitted the same questions to ChatGPT. The conditions evaluated were carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), cervical myelopathy (CM), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and hip osteoarthritis (HOA). Answers were categorized as either correct, partially correct, incorrect, or a differential diagnosis. The percentage of correct answers and reproducibility were calculated. The reproducibility between days and raters were calculated using the Fleiss \u03ba coefficient. Answers that recommended that the patient seek medical attention were recategorized according to the strength of the recommendation as defined by the study. Results: The ratios of correct answers were 25/25, 1/25, 24/25, 16/25, and 17/25 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The ratios of incorrect answers were 23/25 for CM and 0/25 for all other conditions. The reproducibility between days was 1.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The reproducibility between raters was 1.0, 0.1, 0.64, -0.12, and 0.04 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. Among the answers recommending medical attention, the phrases \"essential,\" \"recommended,\" \"best,\" and \"important\" were used. Specifically, \"essential\" occurred in 4 out of 125, \"recommended\" in 12 out of 125, \"best\" in 6 out of 125, and \"important\" in 94 out of 125 answers. Additionally, 7 out of the 125 answers did not include a recommendation to seek medical attention. Conclusions: The accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT to self-diagnose five common orthopedic conditions were inconsistent. The accuracy could potentially be improved by adding symptoms that could easily identify a specific location. Only a few answers were accompanied by a strong recommendation to seek medical attention according to our study standards. Although ChatGPT could serve as a potential first step in accessing care, we found variability in accurate self-diagnosis. Given the risk of harm with self-diagnosis without medical follow-up, it would be prudent for an NLP to include clear language alerting patients to seek expert medical opinions.

Such tools include symptom checkers that provide users with a potential diagnosis after responding to a set of probes about their symptoms. Although the potential for their utility is great, little is known about such tools' actual use and effects. Objective: We aimed to understand who uses a web-based artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker and its purposes, how they evaluate the experience of the web-based interview and quality of the information, what they intend to do with the recommendation, and predictors of future use. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of web-based health information seekers following the completion of a symptom checker visit (N=2437). Measures of comprehensibility, confidence, usefulness, health-related anxiety, empowerment, and intention to use in the future were assessed. ANOVAs and the Wilcoxon rank sum test examined mean outcome differences in racial, ethnic, and sex groups. The relationship between perceptions of the symptom checker and intention to follow recommended actions was assessed using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Buoy users were well-educated (1384/1704, 81.22% college or higher), primarily White (1227/1693, 72.47%), and female (2069/2437, 84.89%). Most had insurance (1449/1630, 88.89%), a regular health care provider (1307/1709, 76.48%), and reported good health (1000/1703, 58.72%). Three types of symptoms-pain (855/2437, 35.08%), gynecological issues (293/2437, 12.02%), and masses or lumps (204/2437, 8.37%)-accounted for almost half (1352/2437, 55.48%) of site visits. Buoy's top three primary recommendations split across less-serious triage categories: primary care physician in 2 weeks (754/2141, 35.22%), self-treatment (452/2141, 21.11%), and primary care in 1 to 2 days (373/2141, 17.42%). Common diagnoses were musculoskeletal (303/2437, 12.43%), gynecological (304/2437, 12.47%) and skin conditions (297/2437, 12.19%), and infectious diseases (300/2437, 12.31%). Users generally reported high confidence in Buoy, found it useful and easy to understand, and said that Buoy made them feel less anxious and more empowered to seek medical help. Users for whom Buoy recommended \"Waiting/Watching\" or \"Self-Treatment\" had strongest intentions to comply, whereas those advised to seek primary care had weaker intentions. Compared with White users, Latino and Black users had significantly more confidence in Buoy (P<.05), and the former also found it significantly more useful (P<.05). Latino (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.22-3.25) and Black (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.57-3.66) users also had stronger intentions to discuss recommendations with a provider than White users. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the potential utility of a web-based health information tool to empower people to seek care and reduce health-related anxiety. However, despite encouraging results suggesting the tool may fulfill unmet health information needs among women and Black and Latino adults, analyses of the user base illustrate persistent second-level digital divide effects.",

However, little is known about the characteristics of the patients who use these resources, their rationale for use, and whether they find them accurate and useful. Objective: The study aimed to examine patients' experiences using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted online symptom checker. Methods: An online survey was administered between March 2, 2018, through March 15, 2018, to US users of the Isabel Symptom Checker within 6 months of their use. User characteristics, experiences of symptom checker use, experiences discussing results with physicians, and prior personal history of experiencing a diagnostic error were collected. Results: A total of 329 usable responses was obtained. The mean respondent age was 48.0 (SD 16.7) years; most were women (230/304, 75.7%) and white (271/304, 89.1%). Patients most commonly used the symptom checker to better understand the causes of their symptoms (232/304, 76.3%), followed by for deciding whether to seek care (101/304, 33.2%) or where (eg, primary or urgent care: 63/304, 20.7%), obtaining medical advice without going to a doctor (48/304, 15.8%), and understanding their diagnoses better (39/304, 12.8%). Most patients reported receiving useful information for their health problems (274/304, 90.1%), with half reporting positive health effects (154/302, 51.0%). Most patients perceived it to be useful as a diagnostic tool (253/301, 84.1%), as a tool providing insights leading them closer to correct diagnoses (231/303, 76.2%), and reported they would use it again (278/304, 91.4%). Patients who discussed findings with their physicians (103/213, 48.4%) more often felt physicians were interested (42/103, 40.8%) than not interested in learning about the tool's results (24/103, 23.3%) and more often felt physicians were open (62/103, 60.2%) than not open (21/103, 20.4%) to discussing the results. Compared with patients who had not previously experienced diagnostic errors (missed or delayed diagnoses: 123/304, 40.5%), patients who had previously experienced diagnostic errors (181/304, 59.5%) were more likely to use the symptom checker to determine where they should seek care (15/123, 12.2% vs 48/181, 26.5%; P=.002), but they less often felt that physicians were interested in discussing the tool's results (20/34, 59% vs 22/69, 32%; P=.04). Conclusions: Despite ongoing concerns about symptom checker accuracy, a large patient-user group perceived an AI-assisted symptom checker as useful for diagnosis. Formal validation studies evaluating symptom checker accuracy and effectiveness in real-world practice could provide additional useful information about their benefit.",

Buoy's top three primary recommendations split across less-serious triage categories: primary care physician in 2 weeks (754/2141, 35.22%), self-treatment (452/2141, 21.11%), and primary care in 1 to 2 days (373/2141, 17.42%). Common diagnoses were musculoskeletal (303/2437, 12.43%), gynecological (304/2437, 12.47%) and skin conditions (297/2437, 12.19%), and infectious diseases (300/2437, 12.31%). Users generally reported high confidence in Buoy, found it useful and easy to understand, and said that Buoy made them feel less anxious and more empowered to seek medical help. Users for whom Buoy recommended \"Waiting/Watching\" or \"Self-Treatment\" had strongest intentions to comply, whereas those advised to seek primary care had weaker intentions. Compared with White users, Latino and Black users had significantly more confidence in Buoy (P<.05), and the former also found it significantly more useful (P<.05). Latino (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.22-3.25) and Black (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.57-3.66) users also had stronger intentions to discuss recommendations with a provider than White users. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the potential utility of a web-based health information tool to empower people to seek care and reduce health-related anxiety. However, despite encouraging results suggesting the tool may fulfill unmet health information needs among women and Black and Latino adults, analyses of the user base illustrate persistent second-level digital divide effects.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained tremendous popularity recently, especially the use of natural language processing (NLP). ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art chatbot capable of creating natural conversations using NLP. The use of AI in medicine can have a tremendous impact on health care delivery. Although some studies have evaluated ChatGPT's accuracy in self-diagnosis, there is no research regarding its precision and the degree to which it recommends medical consultations. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to accurately and precisely self-diagnose common orthopedic diseases, as well as the degree of recommendation it provides for medical consultations. Methods: Over a 5-day course, each of the study authors submitted the same questions to ChatGPT. The conditions evaluated were carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), cervical myelopathy (CM), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and hip osteoarthritis (HOA). Answers were categorized as either correct, partially correct, incorrect, or a differential diagnosis. The percentage of correct answers and reproducibility were calculated. The reproducibility between days and raters were calculated using the Fleiss \u03ba coefficient. Answers that recommended that the patient seek medical attention were recategorized according to the strength of the recommendation as defined by the study. Results: The ratios of correct answers were 25/25, 1/25, 24/25, 16/25, and 17/25 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The ratios of incorrect answers were 23/25 for CM and 0/25 for all other conditions. The reproducibility between days was 1.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The reproducibility between raters was 1.0, 0.1, 0.64, -0.12, and 0.04 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. Among the answers recommending medical attention, the phrases \"essential,\" \"recommended,\" \"best,\" and \"important\" were used. Specifically, \"essential\" occurred in 4 out of 125, \"recommended\" in 12 out of 125, \"best\" in 6 out of 125, and \"important\" in 94 out of 125 answers. Additionally, 7 out of the 125 answers did not include a recommendation to seek medical attention. Conclusions: The accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT to self-diagnose five common orthopedic conditions were inconsistent. The accuracy could potentially be improved by adding symptoms that could easily identify a specific location. Only a few answers were accompanied by a strong recommendation to seek medical attention according to our study standards. Although ChatGPT could serve as a potential first step in accessing care, we found variability in accurate self-diagnosis. Given the risk of harm with self-diagnosis without medical follow-up, it would be prudent for an NLP to include clear language alerting patients to seek expert medical opinions. We hope to shed further light on the use of AI in a future clinical study.",

However, little is known about the characteristics of the patients who use these resources, their rationale for use, and whether they find them accurate and useful. Objective: The study aimed to examine patients' experiences using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted online symptom checker. Methods: An online survey was administered between March 2, 2018, through March 15, 2018, to US users of the Isabel Symptom Checker within 6 months of their use. User characteristics, experiences of symptom checker use, experiences discussing results with physicians, and prior personal history of experiencing a diagnostic error were collected. Results: A total of 329 usable responses was obtained. The mean respondent age was 48.0 (SD 16.7) years; most were women (230/304, 75.7%) and white (271/304, 89.1%). Patients most commonly used the symptom checker to better understand the causes of their symptoms (232/304, 76.3%), followed by for deciding whether to seek care (101/304, 33.2%) or where (eg, primary or urgent care: 63/304, 20.7%), obtaining medical advice without going to a doctor (48/304, 15.8%), and understanding their diagnoses better (39/304, 12.8%). Most patients reported receiving useful information for their health problems (274/304, 90.1%), with half reporting positive health effects (154/302, 51.0%). Most patients perceived it to be useful as a diagnostic tool (253/301, 84.1%), as a tool providing insights leading them closer to correct diagnoses (231/303, 76.2%), and reported they would use it again (278/304, 91.4%). Patients who discussed findings with their physicians (103/213, 48.4%) more often felt physicians were interested (42/103, 40.8%) than not interested in learning about the tool's results (24/103, 23.3%) and more often felt physicians were open (62/103, 60.2%) than not open (21/103, 20.4%) to discussing the results. Compared with patients who had not previously experienced diagnostic errors (missed or delayed diagnoses: 123/304, 40.5%), patients who had previously experienced diagnostic errors (181/304, 59.5%) were more likely to use the symptom checker to determine where they should seek care (15/123, 12.2% vs 48/181, 26.5%; P=.002), but they less often felt that physicians were interested in discussing the tool's results (20/34, 59% vs 22/69, 32%; P=.04). Conclusions: Despite ongoing concerns about symptom checker accuracy, a large patient-user group perceived an AI-assisted symptom checker as useful for diagnosis. Formal validation studies evaluating symptom checker accuracy and effectiveness in real-world practice could provide additional useful information about their benefit.",

        "answer": "Healio: High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can have a significant impact on heart health. Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease, which includes conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. When blood pressure is consistently elevated, it can cause damage to the blood vessels leading to the heart, increasing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, hypertension can cause the heart to work harder, leading to cardiac remodeling and potentially increasing the risk of heart failure. It is important to manage blood pressure through lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication to reduce the risk of heart disease and promote overall cardiovascular health.",

Methods: Using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the independent effects of education, intelligence, or cognition on hypertension (FinnGen study, 70 651 cases/223 663 controls; UK Biobank, 77 723 cases/330 366 controls) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure, 757 601 participants), and used 2-step Mendelian randomization to evaluate 25 potential mediators of the association and calculate the mediated proportions. Results: Meta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses.

Methods: Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated using summary statistics from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure-Genome Wide Association Study (n=299 024). Adjusted nonlinear mixed-effects regression models were used, including a natural splines term for BP-PRS with outcomes of fluid intelligence, reaction time (RT), and composite attention score. Moderating effects of age, sex, and antihypertensive use were assessed in separate models. Results: There were 448 575 participants (mean age, 56.3 years; age range, 37-72 years) included in the analysis after genetic and neurological disease exclusions. Genetic propensity for high SBP had an approximately linear association with worsened fluid intelligence (P=0.0018). This relationship was significantly moderated by age (P<0.0001). By contrast, genetic propensity for high and low SBP and diastolic BP predicted worse attention function (P=0.0099 and P=0.0019), with high PRSs predicting worse function than low PRSs. Genetic propensity for low SBP and diastolic BP was associated with considerably worse RTs, while for high SBP-PRSs, the RT plateaued (P<0.0001). The relationships between RT and the PRSs were significantly moderated by sex (P<0.0001) and antihypertensive use (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Genetic propensity for high and low BP impacts on midlife cognition in subtle ways and differentially affects cognitive domains. While a genetic propensity to low BP may preserve nontimed tests in midlife, it may come at a trade-off with worsened attention scores and RT.",

The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method: The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant indirect effects for reading comprehension in women (7.2%; 95% CI [0.7, 19.4]) and men (7.2%; 95% CI [0.8, 19.1]), and depressive symptoms (11.8%; 95% CI [2.5, 26.6]) and perceived constraint (6.7%, 95% CI [0.7, 19.1]) in women. Conclusions: Evidence suggested that reading comprehension in women and men, and depressive symptoms and perceived constraint in women, may mediate some of the association between education and CHD risk.

Methods: Using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the independent effects of education, intelligence, or cognition on hypertension (FinnGen study, 70 651 cases/223 663 controls; UK Biobank, 77 723 cases/330 366 controls) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure, 757 601 participants), and used 2-step Mendelian randomization to evaluate 25 potential mediators of the association and calculate the mediated proportions. Results: Meta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%).

Conclusions: Our findings illustrated the causal, independent impact of education on hypertension and blood pressure and outlined cardiometabolic mediators as priority targets for prevention of hypertension attributable to low education.",

Methods: Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated using summary statistics from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure-Genome Wide Association Study (n=299 024). Adjusted nonlinear mixed-effects regression models were used, including a natural splines term for BP-PRS with outcomes of fluid intelligence, reaction time (RT), and composite attention score. Moderating effects of age, sex, and antihypertensive use were assessed in separate models. Results: There were 448 575 participants (mean age, 56.3 years; age range, 37-72 years) included in the analysis after genetic and neurological disease exclusions. Genetic propensity for high SBP had an approximately linear association with worsened fluid intelligence (P=0.0018). This relationship was significantly moderated by age (P<0.0001). By contrast, genetic propensity for high and low SBP and diastolic BP predicted worse attention function (P=0.0099 and P=0.0019), with high PRSs predicting worse function than low PRSs. Genetic propensity for low SBP and diastolic BP was associated with considerably worse RTs, while for high SBP-PRSs, the RT plateaued (P<0.0001). The relationships between RT and the PRSs were significantly moderated by sex (P<0.0001) and antihypertensive use (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Genetic propensity for high and low BP impacts on midlife cognition in subtle ways and differentially affects cognitive domains. While a genetic propensity to low BP may preserve nontimed tests in midlife, it may come at a trade-off with worsened attention scores and RT.",

        "answer": "Healio: According to the constrained disorder principle (CDP), biological systems are inherently variable, and this variability can be observed in the effects of stopping regular exercise. Regular physical activity (PA) has been shown to promote mental and physical health, but the consequences of stopping exercise can be detrimental.\n\nSedentary behavior (SB) has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to a clustering of risk factors for CVD. Additionally, inactive individuals are more likely to experience muscle weakness, decreased bone density, and a decline in cognitive function.\n\nResearch has shown that incorporating variability into PA regimens for inactive adults can enhance their physical and cognitive benefits. However, it is important to note that the effects of stopping exercise can vary depending on individual factors, such as age, fitness level, and health status.\n\nIt is essential to maintain a consistent exercise routine to experience the full benefits of physical activity. If you have stopped exercising regularly, it may be beneficial to consult with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized exercise plan that takes into account your individual needs and health status.",

Nevertheless, inactivity is a worldwide pandemic, and methods to augment exercise benefits are required. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) characterizes biological systems based on their inherent variability. We aimed to investigate the association between intra-individual variability in PA and disability among non-athlete adults. Methods: In this retrospective analysis of the longitudinal SHARE survey, we included non-disabled adults aged >50 with at least six visits over 14 years. Self-reported PA frequency was documented bi- to triennially. Low PA intensity was defined as vigorous PA frequency less than once a week. Stable PA was described as an unchanged PA intensity in all consecutive middle observations. The primary outcome was defined as a physical limitation in everyday activities at the end of the survey. Secondary outcomes were cognitive functions, including short-term memory, long-term memory, and verbal fluency. Results: The study included 2,049 non-disabled adults with a mean age of 53 and 49.1 % women. In the initially high PA intensity group, variability in PA was associated with increased physical disability prevalence (23.3% vs. 33.2%, stablevs. unstablePA; P<0.01; adjusted P<0.01). In the initially low PA intensity group, variability was associated with a reduced physical disability (45.6% vs. 33.3%, stablevs. unstable PA; P=0.02; adjusted P=0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in cognitive parameters between the groups. Among individuals with the same low PA intensity at the beginning and end of follow-up, variability was associated with reduced physical disability (56.9% vs. 36.5%, stablevs. unstablePA; P=0.02; adjusted P=0.04) and improved short-term memory (score change: -0.28 vs. +0.29, stablevs. unstable PA; P=0.05). Conclusion: Incorporating variability into PA regimens of inactive adults may enhance their physical and cognitive benefits.",

Prader-Willi syndrome is the most common genetic disease associated with obesity, and brings with it behavioral and emotional problems that need complex management. Research into the effect of physical activity programs on Prader-Willi syndrome is limited and it is frequently argued that if a physical activity program is too complex, the participants are more likely to drop out. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the physiological adaptation effect of a physical activity program with increasing complexity and load, in a boy and a girl with Prader-Willi syndrome by assessing changes in lipid profile, body composition, and physical fitness parameters. Case presentation: Case 1 was an 11-year-old girl, mixed race (brown), with an intelligence quotient of 68, 52.0 % body fat, and a body mass index of 45.3 kg/m(2). The Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosis was made when she was 5-years old and was found to be due to an imprinting genomic defect. Case 2 was a 14-year-old boy, mixed race (brown), with an intelligence quotient of 74, 48.8 % body fat, and a body mass index of 37.3 kg/m(2). The diagnosis was made when he was 10-years old and was found to be caused by gene deletion. Both participants presented physical characteristics and behavior problems typical of Prader-Willi syndrome. Case 2 presented high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sleep apnea and had to use continuous positive airway pressure to sleep. Both participants were assessed for 12 weeks (three times a week) using a physical activity program designed to improve strength and muscle hypertrophy. The work load was progressively adjusted as necessary and new exercises were added to the program. Prior to the program, the participants' parents received instructions about managing problem behavior and advice about nutrition. Conclusions: After physical activity program several health markers assessed by biological tests and parental report had improved in both participants. The participants positively accepted the adaptations made to the physical activity program during the study. More studies are necessary to assess the benefits of physical activity in the Prader-Willi syndrome population.",

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

                    "abstract": "Background: The physical activity level of older adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) is extremely low, and their fitness levels are far beneath accepted norms for older people with normal intelligence and comparable with frail older people. A physical activity programme, including an education programme, was developed for older adults with ID using behaviour change techniques. The programme aimed at improving or maintaining adequate levels of physical activity (primary outcome measure) and motor fitness, cardio respiratory fitness, morphologic and metabolic fitness, activities of daily living, cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms (secondary outcome measures). Method: The programme's efficacy was evaluated in a cluster-randomised clinical trial among people aged 43 years and over with mild-moderate levels of ID. Five day-activity centres were randomised to the participation group. In these centres, 81 older adults participated in groups of 8 to 10 in the programme, three times a week during 8 months. The programme was executed by physical activity instructors and staff of day-activity centres. Five other day-activity centres were randomised to the control group; 70 older adults in these centres received care as usual. The generalised linear model with mixed effects was used to test the programme's effectiveness. Results: Significant effects were found on physical activity, muscle strength, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level and cognitive functioning, in favour of the programme's participants. No significant improvements were found on balance, serum glucose, weight, waist circumference, walking speed, mobility, depression or instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusions: The physical activity and fitness programme has established small but significant effects in this sample, but generalising the findings to other settings is difficult due to significant participant dropout. Implementation of evidence-based physical activity programmes among older adults with ID is recommended. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of physical activity on daily life functioning and the development on chronic diseases in the long run.",

Prader-Willi syndrome is the most common genetic disease associated with obesity, and brings with it behavioral and emotional problems that need complex management. Research into the effect of physical activity programs on Prader-Willi syndrome is limited and it is frequently argued that if a physical activity program is too complex, the participants are more likely to drop out. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the physiological adaptation effect of a physical activity program with increasing complexity and load, in a boy and a girl with Prader-Willi syndrome by assessing changes in lipid profile, body composition, and physical fitness parameters. Case presentation: Case 1 was an 11-year-old girl, mixed race (brown), with an intelligence quotient of 68, 52.0 % body fat, and a body mass index of 45.3 kg/m(2). The Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosis was made when she was 5-years old and was found to be due to an imprinting genomic defect. Case 2 was a 14-year-old boy, mixed race (brown), with an intelligence quotient of 74, 48.8 % body fat, and a body mass index of 37.3 kg/m(2). The diagnosis was made when he was 10-years old and was found to be caused by gene deletion. Both participants presented physical characteristics and behavior problems typical of Prader-Willi syndrome. Case 2 presented high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sleep apnea and had to use continuous positive airway pressure to sleep. Both participants were assessed for 12 weeks (three times a week) using a physical activity program designed to improve strength and muscle hypertrophy. The work load was progressively adjusted as necessary and new exercises were added to the program. Prior to the program, the participants' parents received instructions about managing problem behavior and advice about nutrition. Conclusions: After physical activity program several health markers assessed by biological tests and parental report had improved in both participants. The participants positively accepted the adaptations made to the physical activity program during the study. More studies are necessary to assess the benefits of physical activity in the Prader-Willi syndrome population.",

Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline. Methods: Fifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: Overall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants. Conclusion: Improvements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.",

Nevertheless, inactivity is a worldwide pandemic, and methods to augment exercise benefits are required. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) characterizes biological systems based on their inherent variability. We aimed to investigate the association between intra-individual variability in PA and disability among non-athlete adults. Methods: In this retrospective analysis of the longitudinal SHARE survey, we included non-disabled adults aged >50 with at least six visits over 14 years. Self-reported PA frequency was documented bi- to triennially. Low PA intensity was defined as vigorous PA frequency less than once a week. Stable PA was described as an unchanged PA intensity in all consecutive middle observations. The primary outcome was defined as a physical limitation in everyday activities at the end of the survey. Secondary outcomes were cognitive functions, including short-term memory, long-term memory, and verbal fluency. Results: The study included 2,049 non-disabled adults with a mean age of 53 and 49.1 % women. In the initially high PA intensity group, variability in PA was associated with increased physical disability prevalence (23.3% vs. 33.2%, stablevs. unstablePA; P<0.01; adjusted P<0.01). In the initially low PA intensity group, variability was associated with a reduced physical disability (45.6% vs. 33.3%, stablevs. unstable PA; P=0.02; adjusted P=0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in cognitive parameters between the groups. Among individuals with the same low PA intensity at the beginning and end of follow-up, variability was associated with reduced physical disability (56.9% vs. 36.5%, stablevs. unstablePA; P=0.02; adjusted P=0.04) and improved short-term memory (score change: -0.28 vs. +0.29, stablevs. unstable PA; P=0.05).

        "answer": "Healio: The effects of quitting smoking on a person's health can be significant and numerous. Within 20 minutes of quitting, the heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to normal levels. Within 48 hours, the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease, and the oxygen levels increase. This can lead to improved lung function and overall breathing.\n\nOne year after quitting, the risk of heart disease is reduced by 50%, and the risk of stroke is reduced by 30%. Five years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer is reduced by 30%, and the risk of mouth, throat, and bladder cancers is reduced by 20%. Quitting smoking also improves overall health by reducing the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.\n\nIt is important to note that quitting smoking can also lead to withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, and insomnia. These symptoms can be managed with support and medication, and the benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh any potential discomfort.\n\nIt is also important to note that quitting smoking is a complex process and it is not always easy to quit. It is important to have a strong support system, such as a counselor or a support group, to help manage the cravings and the withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, medications such as bupropion (Zyban) and varenicline (Chantix) can help reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and cravings.\n\nIn summary, quitting smoking can have a significant positive impact on a person's health, improving lung function, reducing the risk of various cancers and cardiovascular disease, and",

Results: Having utilised data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), our results showed that one standard deviation increase in MDD-PGS was associated with increased odds of being a moderate-heavy smoker (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, SE = 0.04, 95%CI = 1.00-1.24, p = 0.028).

                    "abstract": "Background: The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client's statements, using a generative language model. Objective: This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections. Methods: Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants' readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections. Results: The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations. Conclusions: The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.",

Combat rather than PTSD emerged as more significant to smoking status, suggesting that it may be the traumatic stress itself rather than the development of a poststress disorder that is more germane to smoking in war veterans.",

Methods: A cohort of male Australian Vietnam veterans (N = 388) was interviewed twice, 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized psychiatric diagnostic and health interviews and assessment of combat exposure. The smoking trajectory over time revealed a spectrum of outcomes (never smoked, early quitters, late quitters, and continuing smokers). Analysis used multivariate statistics to assess the relative contributions of combat trauma exposure and PTSD while controlling for potential confounders. Results: The trajectory of smoking over time revealed that 21.9% of veterans had never smoked, 45.1% had quit smoking by the time of wave 1, 16.2% were current smokers at wave 1 who had quit by the time of wave 2, 2.8% were late adopters who were current smokers, and 13.9% were continuing smokers. Smoking was associated in single-predictor models with demographics, intelligence, combat exposure, PTSD symptom clusters and diagnosis, and alcohol disorders. Multivariate analysis revealed that PTSD, combat, and intelligence were related to the smoking spectrum but, after adding demographics and other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses, only combat remained significant. No PTSD symptom cluster uniquely predicted smoking status. Conclusions: The results suggest that trauma exposure in the form of military combat may be a more robust predictor of smoking status over time than PTSD. It may be stress itself, rather than poststress disorder, that is more germane to smoking and failure to quit.

Results: Having utilised data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), our results showed that one standard deviation increase in MDD-PGS was associated with increased odds of being a moderate-heavy smoker (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, SE = 0.04, 95%CI = 1.00-1.24, p = 0.028). There were no other significant associations between SZ-PGS, BD-PGS, or IQ-PGS and smoking initiation, heaviness of smoking and smoking cessation in older adults from the general population in the UK. Conclusions: Smoking is a behaviour that does not appear to share common genetic ground with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and intelligence in older adults, which may suggest that it is more likely to be modifiable by smoking cessation interventions. Once started to smoke, older adults with a higher polygenic predisposition to major depressive disorders are more likely to be moderate to heavy smokers, implying that these adults may require targeted smoking cessation services.",

Despite this, a great number of survivors continue to smoke after the diagnosis. This observational, cross-sectional on-line study aimed to assess the relationship between the impact of cancer diagnosis on survivors and their smoking behavior, and whether emotional intelligence and personality might mediate this relationship. Ninety-four Italian survivors completed a set of questionnaires: Big Five Inventory; Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence; Impact of Event Scale; Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale. The results obtained from the mediation analyses highlighted that the indirect effect on the relationship between the psychological impact of the diagnosis and smoking behaviors was partially mediated by neuroticism (Intrusion: 95% CI [0.00; 0.11]; Avoidance: 95% CI [0.00; 0.18]). Additionally, the data suggested that the relationship between the psychological impact of the diagnosis and smoking behaviors was partially mediated by the utilization of emotions dimension of emotional intelligence (Intrusion: 95% CI [0.00; 0.10]; Avoidance: 95% CI [0.00; 0.22]). Overall, this study suggests the importance of designing interventions to support smoking interruption based on the \"mapping\" of individual needs and emotional regulation strategies.",

        "answer": "Healio: The impact of consuming only fast food on a person's body can be significant and detrimental. Fast food is typically high in calories, added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, and low in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Consuming a diet consisting only of fast food can lead to weight gain, inflammation, and an increased risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Additionally, a diet lacking in essential nutrients can lead to nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency, and B12 deficiency. It is important to maintain a balanced and varied diet that includes a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods to support overall health and well-being.

We examined the relationship between resilience, impulsivity, emotional intelligence and self-esteem, and restrained and compulsive eating. It was assumed that resilience and impulsivity can directly explain unhealthy eating attitudes (restrained and compulsive: both emotional eating and external eating). The study group comprised 211 individuals (105 men and 106 women) aged 20-29, all of whom were living in southern Poland. Measures included the Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-25), the Eysenck's Impulsivity Inventory (IVE), the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory (MSEI), the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE), and the Polish adaptation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). The statistical analysis showed significant and positive correlations between emotional eating and general self-esteem, impulsivity, and weaker (but still significant) correlations with physical attractiveness. External eating was positively and significantly correlated with impulsivity and self-esteem (including physical attractiveness). Restrained eating was also positively and significantly correlated with general self-esteem. Both types of compulsive eating attitudes (emotional and external eating) were significantly and negatively correlated with resilience. Women showed a significantly higher positive correlation between impulsivity and external eating compared to men. The level of intensity of other measures proved similar across the entire study group regardless of sex. Impulsivity had the strongest and most direct significant influence on both emotional eating and external eating, and a negative effect on emotional intelligence. Resilience proved to have a significant impact on all three examined types of eating attitude (a direct negative effect on emotional eating and external eating, and positive direct effect on restrained eating), self-esteem, and emotional intelligence. An important psychological intervening variable in generating unhealthy eating attitudes proved to be self-esteem among both men and women. Emotional intelligence, which remains correlated with resilience, proved independent, with no effect on unhealthy eating attitudes. These results suggest that preventive treatment and educational programs implemented particularly among adolescents and young adults may support development of their psychological resources.",

The study group comprised 211 individuals (105 men and 106 women) aged 20-29, all of whom were living in southern Poland. Measures included the Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-25), the Eysenck's Impulsivity Inventory (IVE), the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory (MSEI), the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE), and the Polish adaptation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). The statistical analysis showed significant and positive correlations between emotional eating and general self-esteem, impulsivity, and weaker (but still significant) correlations with physical attractiveness. External eating was positively and significantly correlated with impulsivity and self-esteem (including physical attractiveness). Restrained eating was also positively and significantly correlated with general self-esteem. Both types of compulsive eating attitudes (emotional and external eating) were significantly and negatively correlated with resilience. Women showed a significantly higher positive correlation between impulsivity and external eating compared to men. The level of intensity of other measures proved similar across the entire study group regardless of sex. Impulsivity had the strongest and most direct significant influence on both emotional eating and external eating, and a negative effect on emotional intelligence. Resilience proved to have a significant impact on all three examined types of eating attitude (a direct negative effect on emotional eating and external eating, and positive direct effect on restrained eating), self-esteem, and emotional intelligence. An important psychological intervening variable in generating unhealthy eating attitudes proved to be self-esteem among both men and women. Emotional intelligence, which remains correlated with resilience, proved independent, with no effect on unhealthy eating attitudes. These results suggest that preventive treatment and educational programs implemented particularly among adolescents and young adults may support development of their psychological resources.",

        "answer": "Healio: According to the PubMed abstracts you provided, chronic stress can have a significant impact on a person's mental health. Studies have shown that chronic stress can lead to the development of mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, in a significant portion of the population. Additionally, the abstracts suggest that the relationship between stressful life events and depression is complex and mediated by factors such as openness to experience.\n\nIt is important to note that the prevalence and predictors of enduring mental health are not well understood, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between chronic stress and mental health. However, it is clear that chronic stress can have a profound impact on a person's mental well-being, and it is important to manage stress levels and seek professional help if symptoms persist or worsen over time.\n\nIn summary, chronic stress can have a significant impact on a person's mental health, and it is important to manage stress levels and seek professional help if symptoms persist or worsen over time.\n\nWould you like me to answer any other questions?",

The review indicates that merely beginning medical studies is a risk factor for stress, and that medical professionals, who are vulnerable to extreme work stress, say that they do not receive enough support from their co-workers. They are also often notably impulsive, introverted, neurotic and perfectionist, with low emotional intelligence and agreeableness, as well as low and external locus of control. Additionally, from longitudinal studies we have been able to identify psychological factors underpinning admission to a medical university that may be useful for predicting future stress in medical career. The results of this study may be taken into account when organizing psychological intervention programs targeted at educating future medical professionals. It seems that early identification of people at risk could reduce the impact of stress related to medical career and enhance the somatic and mental health of medical professionals.",

Previous studies have found an association between experience of stressful life events and the personality trait of openness to experience, which itself has been associated with intelligence, creativity, risk-taking, and other clinically relevant behaviors. In this study we explore the association between stressful life events and openness to experience as a potential developmental pathway to depression in the Amish and Mennonites, rural populations with high degree of social and environmental homogeneity. Methods: Participants in the Amish Connectome Project (n=531) were assessed with the NEO personality inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Maryland Trait and State Depression scales, a Life Stressors Inventory, and cognitive tests. Results: We found that stressful life events were significantly associated with openness to experience; that participants with a history of depression exhibited higher levels of openness; and that openness to experience was related to overall intelligence but not processing speed or working memory. We found evidence that openness to experience partially mediates the relationship between stressful life events and depression. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study, limiting interpretation of causal pathways. High levels of inter-relatedness among participants may have led to exaggerated effects compared to the general population. Conclusions: Together these findings indicate a complex developmental influence of major stressful life events, which paradoxically by enhancing openness may be associated with both greater intellectual engagement as well as psychopathology.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Anaesthesia is a stressful medical specialty. The reaction to stress is constituted by behavioural, psychological and physiological components. Chronic physiological stress can have negative consequences for health. Objectives: First, we hypothesised that chronic physiological stress is higher for both beginning and late-career consultant anaesthesiologists. Second, we hypothesised that individuals high in emotional intelligence endure lower physiological stress. Design: Cross-sectional biomarker and survey study. Setting: Participants were recruited during the May 2019 annual meeting of the Dutch Anaesthesia Society. Participants: Of the 1348 colleagues who attended the meeting, 184 (70 male/114 female) participated in the study. Of the study participants, 123 (67%) were consultant anaesthesiologists (52 male/71 female) and 61 (33%) were resident anaesthesiologists (18 male/43 female). Exclusion criteria were endocrine disorders and not having enough hair. Also, experience of a recent major life event led to exclusion from analysis of our hypotheses. Main outcome measures: Chronic physiological stress was measured by hair cortisol concentration. Emotional intelligence was assessed using a validated Dutch version of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. As secondary measures, psychological sources of stress were assessed using validated Dutch versions of the home-work interference (SWING) and the effort-reward imbalance questionnaires. Results: In support of Hypothesis 1, hair cortisol concentration was highest among early and late-career consultant anaesthesiologists (quadratic effect: b = 45.5, SE = 16.1, t = 2.8, P = 0.006, R2 = 0.14). This nonlinear pattern was not mirrored by self-reported sources of psychological stress. Our results did not support Hypothesis 2; we found no evidence for a relationship between emotional intelligence and physiological stress. Conclusion: In the early and later phases of an anaesthesiologist's career, physiological chronic stress is higher than in the middle of the career. However, this physiological response could not be explained from known sources of psychological stress. We discuss these findings against the background of key differences between physiological and psychological stress.",

Previous studies have found an association between experience of stressful life events and the personality trait of openness to experience, which itself has been associated with intelligence, creativity, risk-taking, and other clinically relevant behaviors. In this study we explore the association between stressful life events and openness to experience as a potential developmental pathway to depression in the Amish and Mennonites, rural populations with high degree of social and environmental homogeneity. Methods: Participants in the Amish Connectome Project (n=531) were assessed with the NEO personality inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Maryland Trait and State Depression scales, a Life Stressors Inventory, and cognitive tests. Results: We found that stressful life events were significantly associated with openness to experience; that participants with a history of depression exhibited higher levels of openness; and that openness to experience was related to overall intelligence but not processing speed or working memory. We found evidence that openness to experience partially mediates the relationship between stressful life events and depression. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study, limiting interpretation of causal pathways. High levels of inter-relatedness among participants may have led to exaggerated effects compared to the general population. Conclusions: Together these findings indicate a complex developmental influence of major stressful life events, which paradoxically by enhancing openness may be associated with both greater intellectual engagement as well as psychopathology.",

These effects may include impaired intelligence development in children, declines in cognitive performance in older adults, and an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Additionally, the presence of complex health problems and lower premorbid cognitive function may weaken the relationship between insomnia and cognitive impairment. However, it is important to note that the results from empirical studies examining the relationship between insomnia and cognitive impairment are mixed, and some studies have found no observable impairment in working memory in older individuals with insomnia.",

Methods: Between June 2009 and April 2010, 316 grade 5 students aged 10-11 years were selected from four primary schools in four administrative districts of Changsha, China by stratified random sampling. The intelligence characteristics of children with varying degrees of sleep deprivation were investigated using the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Results: A total of 286 valid questionnaires were received, with a response rate of 90.5%. The survey was comprised of a sleep deprivation group (sleep time <8 hours per night; n=180) and a control group (sleep time \u22658 hours per night; n=106). The sleep deprivation group had significantly lower subtest scores, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full scale IQ (P<0.05) and significantly lower verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score compared with the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the moderate sleep deprivation subgroup had significantly decreased VIQ and full scale IQ as well as verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score (P<0.05), and the severe sleep deprivation subgroup showed decreases in all scores (P<0.05). The sleep deprivation group and moderate and severe sleep deprivation subgroups had significantly higher proportions of children with VIQ-PIQ imbalance than the control group. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation adversely affects intelligence development, especially VIQ, in primary school students, and the adverse effects of sleep deprivation are mainly seen in students with moderate and severe sleep deprivation.",

Recent neuro-imaging studies have demonstrated frontal lobe hypo-activation among insomniac populations when compared with healthy, good sleepers.

This study aimed to investigate whether older insomnia sufferers demonstrate significantly impaired performance on a challenging working memory task when compared with age-matched good sleepers. Forty-nine older individuals (mean age = 69.43 years, SD = 4.83) suffering from sleep maintenance insomnia were compared with 49 age-matched good sleepers.

Older individuals with insomnia did not display an observable impairment of working memory in this study relative to good sleepers.

We also tested whether individuals with insomnia who reported seeking treatment for their sleep problems (treatment-seekers) showed greater impairment than other individuals with insomnia (non-treatment-seekers). The role of key confounders, including childhood cognitive ability and comorbid health conditions, was evaluated. Measurements: Insomnia was diagnosed at age 38 according to DSM-IV criteria.

Childhood cognitive functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Results: A total of 949 cohort members were assessed for insomnia symptoms and other study measures at age 38.

Results from empirical studies examining associations between insomnia and cognitive impairment, however, are mixed. Research is needed that compares treatment-seeking and community-based insomnia study samples, measures subjective as well as objective cognitive functioning, and considers participants' pre-insomnia cognitive function. Design and participants: We used data from the Dunedin Study, a representative birth cohort of 1,037 individuals, to examine whether insomnia in early midlife was associated with subjective and objective cognitive functioning. We also tested whether individuals with insomnia who reported seeking treatment for their sleep problems (treatment-seekers) showed greater impairment than other individuals with insomnia (non-treatment-seekers). The role of key confounders, including childhood cognitive ability and comorbid health conditions, was evaluated. Measurements: Insomnia was diagnosed at age 38 according to DSM-IV criteria. Objective neuropsychological assessments at age 38 included the WAIS-IV IQ test, the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Trail-Making Test. Childhood cognitive functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Results: A total of 949 cohort members were assessed for insomnia symptoms and other study measures at age 38. Although cohort members with insomnia (n = 186, 19.6%) had greater subjective cognitive impairment than their peers at age 38, they did not exhibit greater objective impairment on formal testing. Treatment-seekers, however, exhibited significant objective impairment compared to non-treatment-seekers. Controlling for comorbidity, daytime impairment, and medications slightly decreased this association. Childhood cognitive deficits antedated the adult cognitive deficits of treatment-seekers. Conclusions: Links between insomnia and cognitive impairment may be strongest among individuals who seek clinical treatment. Clinicians should take into account the presence of complex health problems and lower premorbid cognitive function when planning treatment for insomnia patients.",

Methods: We analyzed data from 1190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database.

Results: All short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers, regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined, self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1190 participants. Conclusions: Individuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore, there is a reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction, in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity, than they may assume.

        "answer": "Healio: The body's reaction to suddenly stopping medication can vary depending on the medication and the individual's health status. Here are some possible reactions:\n\n1. Withdrawal symptoms: Stopping certain medications, such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and antidepressants, can lead to withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and muscle aches. These symptoms can be uncomfortable and can last for several days to weeks.\n2. Return of symptoms: If the medication was being taken to treat a medical condition, stopping the medication can cause the symptoms to return. For example, if someone was taking medication for depression and stops taking it, they may experience a return of depressive symptoms.\n3. Adverse drug reactions: Stopping medication can also lead to adverse drug reactions, such as an allergic reaction or a severe reaction to the medication. In rare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.\n4. Drug interactions: If the medication was taken in combination with other medications, stopping one of the medications can lead to drug interactions. These interactions can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, dizziness, and changes in blood pressure.\n5. Dependence and withdrawal: Some medications, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms when stopped suddenly. These symptoms can include anxiety, insomnia, and muscle aches, and can be uncomfortable.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional before stopping any medication, as they can provide guidance on how to safely stop the medication and manage any withdrawal symptoms.",

Studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: The search resulted in 512 unique records, of which fifteen met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen scales were identified. All scales assessed adverse effects of psychotropics only.

This study was aimed at investigating clinical features of patients with a prolonged depressive state for years, showing minute schizophrenia-like symptoms without any full-fledged psychotic symptoms. Method: The subjects were 170 male inpatients with depression or a depressive state who were admitted to Kyorin University Hospital between April 200X and March 200X + 3. One of the reasons for their admission was to make a differential diagnosis. The diagnoses of fifteen patients (mean age at onset: 29.5 +/- 8.5 years, and mean age at their first visit to a psychiatrist: 34.3 +/- 10.0 years), who had been diagnosed with depression and treated with various kinds of antidepressants for years (mean period: 4.9 +/- 3.4 years) were changed to persistent depression with minute schizophrenia-like symptoms according to \"pluridimensional assessment,\" which takes the following factors into consideration: a premorbid character, predicting situations or life events, clinical features, psychological tests, reactions to treatment, and the course and social outcome. The psychopathology of these fifteen patients was closely investigated. Results: The investigation revealed that: 1) All patients had a premorbid \"schizoid tendency\", which was defined as more than two of three character markers of \"Schizothymie\", described by E. Kretschmer. 2) Most of the patients clinically manifested after low-level psychosocial stress had activated hypersensitivity to the surroundings. 3) In addition to depressive symptoms delineated in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), clinical features included repeated physical complaints, which were poorly explained, suicidal behaviors without any understandable conflicts, unexpected arrogant attitudes toward medical staff and other patients, and superficial, simplistic, and monotonous speech and odd thoughts. They were regarded as minute symptoms of schizophrenia, which should not be overlooked. 4) They showed clear evidence of severe cognitive impairment in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III) and in the Landscape Montage Technique (LMT). The results of these psychological tests, which should be assessed as reference materials in a clinical diagnosis, were low and bizarre when their premorbid social functioning was considered, which may be concordant with their latest defective social functioning. 5) Pharmacotherapy involving any kind of antidepressant had not been effective, and, in some patients switching to or adding antipsychotic drugs effectively reduced their minute schizophrenia-like symptoms, hypersensitivity, and loss of motivation. 6) Two patients committed suicide, three were demoted from regular to contractual employment, and the others are now undergoing rehabilitation together with schizophrenic patients in regional day-care and occupational therapy centers. Conclusions: Clinicians should explore the possibility that manifested mood changes conceal minute schizophrenia-like symptoms. Such patients should be pluridimensionally assessed. Therapeutic strategies for schizophrenic patients may be more appropriate for the patients investigated in this study.",

                    "abstract": "Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can have serious consequences for patient health and well-being. Patients who are taking multiple medications may be at an increased risk of experiencing adverse events or drug toxicity if they are not aware of potential interactions between their medications. Many times, patients self-prescribe medications without knowing DDI. Objective The objective is to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, a large language model, in predicting and explaining common DDIs. Methods A total of 40 DDIs lists were prepared from previously published literature. This list was used to converse with ChatGPT with a two-stage question. The first question was asked as \"can I take X and Y together?\" with two drug names. After storing the output, the next question was asked. The second question was asked as \"why should I not take X and Y together?\" The output was stored for further analysis. The responses were checked by two pharmacologists and the consensus output was categorized as \"correct\" and \"incorrect.\" The \"correct\" ones were further classified as \"conclusive\" and \"inconclusive.\" The text was checked for reading ease scores and grades of education required to understand the text. Data were tested by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Among the 40 DDI pairs, one answer was incorrect in the first question. Among correct answers, 19 were conclusive and 20 were inconclusive. For the second question, one answer was wrong. Among correct answers, 17 were conclusive and 22 were inconclusive. The mean Flesch reading ease score was 27.64\u00b110.85 in answers to the first question and 29.35\u00b110.16 in answers to the second question, p = 0.47. The mean Flesh-Kincaid grade level was 15.06\u00b12.79 in answers to the first question and 14.85\u00b11.97 in answers to the second question, p = 0.69. When we compared the reading levels with hypothetical 6th grade, the grades were significantly higher than expected (t = 20.57, p < 0.0001 for first answers and t = 28.43, p < 0.0001 for second answers). Conclusion ChatGPT is a partially effective tool for predicting and explaining DDIs. Patients, who may not have immediate access to the healthcare facility for getting information about DDIs, may take help from ChatGPT. However, on several occasions, it may provide incomplete guidance. Further improvement is required for potential usage by patients for getting ideas about DDI.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events. Objectives: To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies. Search methods: In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies. Selection criteria: We included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention. Data collection and analysis: Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses. Main results: We included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low.Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention.In the non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants).Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants).With non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non-serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants). Authors' conclusions: Our findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here.Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non-responders.",

Patients who are taking multiple medications may be at an increased risk of experiencing adverse events or drug toxicity if they are not aware of potential interactions between their medications. Many times, patients self-prescribe medications without knowing DDI. Objective The objective is to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, a large language model, in predicting and explaining common DDIs. Methods A total of 40 DDIs lists were prepared from previously published literature. This list was used to converse with ChatGPT with a two-stage question. The first question was asked as \"can I take X and Y together?\" with two drug names. After storing the output, the next question was asked. The second question was asked as \"why should I not take X and Y together?\" The output was stored for further analysis. The responses were checked by two pharmacologists and the consensus output was categorized as \"correct\" and \"incorrect.\" The \"correct\" ones were further classified as \"conclusive\" and \"inconclusive.\" The text was checked for reading ease scores and grades of education required to understand the text. Data were tested by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Among the 40 DDI pairs, one answer was incorrect in the first question. Among correct answers, 19 were conclusive and 20 were inconclusive. For the second question, one answer was wrong. Among correct answers, 17 were conclusive and 22 were inconclusive. The mean Flesch reading ease score was 27.64\u00b110.85 in answers to the first question and 29.35\u00b110.16 in answers to the second question, p = 0.47. The mean Flesh-Kincaid grade level was 15.06\u00b12.79 in answers to the first question and 14.85\u00b11.97 in answers to the second question, p = 0.69. When we compared the reading levels with hypothetical 6th grade, the grades were significantly higher than expected (t = 20.57, p < 0.0001 for first answers and t = 28.43, p < 0.0001 for second answers). Conclusion ChatGPT is a partially effective tool for predicting and explaining DDIs. Patients, who may not have immediate access to the healthcare facility for getting information about DDIs, may take help from ChatGPT. However, on several occasions, it may provide incomplete guidance. Further improvement is required for potential usage by patients for getting ideas about DDI.",

This study was aimed at investigating clinical features of patients with a prolonged depressive state for years, showing minute schizophrenia-like symptoms without any full-fledged psychotic symptoms. Method: The subjects were 170 male inpatients with depression or a depressive state who were admitted to Kyorin University Hospital between April 200X and March 200X + 3. One of the reasons for their admission was to make a differential diagnosis. The diagnoses of fifteen patients (mean age at onset: 29.5 +/- 8.5 years, and mean age at their first visit to a psychiatrist: 34.3 +/- 10.0 years), who had been diagnosed with depression and treated with various kinds of antidepressants for years (mean period: 4.9 +/- 3.4 years) were changed to persistent depression with minute schizophrenia-like symptoms according to \"pluridimensional assessment,\" which takes the following factors into consideration: a premorbid character, predicting situations or life events, clinical features, psychological tests, reactions to treatment, and the course and social outcome. The psychopathology of these fifteen patients was closely investigated. Results: The investigation revealed that: 1) All patients had a premorbid \"schizoid tendency\", which was defined as more than two of three character markers of \"Schizothymie\", described by E. Kretschmer. 2) Most of the patients clinically manifested after low-level psychosocial stress had activated hypersensitivity to the surroundings. 3) In addition to depressive symptoms delineated in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), clinical features included repeated physical complaints, which were poorly explained, suicidal behaviors without any understandable conflicts, unexpected arrogant attitudes toward medical staff and other patients, and superficial, simplistic, and monotonous speech and odd thoughts. They were regarded as minute symptoms of schizophrenia, which should not be overlooked. 4) They showed clear evidence of severe cognitive impairment in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III) and in the Landscape Montage Technique (LMT). The results of these psychological tests, which should be assessed as reference materials in a clinical diagnosis, were low and bizarre when their premorbid social functioning was considered, which may be concordant with their latest defective social functioning. 5) Pharmacotherapy involving any kind of antidepressant had not been effective, and, in some patients switching to or adding antipsychotic drugs effectively reduced their minute schizophrenia-like symptoms, hypersensitivity, and loss of motivation. 6) Two patients committed suicide, three were demoted from regular to contractual employment, and the others are now undergoing rehabilitation together with schizophrenic patients in regional day-care and occupational therapy centers. Conclusions: Clinicians should explore the possibility that manifested mood changes conceal minute schizophrenia-like symptoms. Such patients should be pluridimensionally assessed. Therapeutic strategies for schizophrenic patients may be more appropriate for the patients investigated in this study.",

Dehydration, which occurs when the body does not have enough water to carry out its functions, can cause headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. In severe cases, it can even lead to organ failure, seizures, and coma. Additionally, a lack of water can cause constipation, which can lead to other health issues such as hemorrhoids and diverticulitis. It is important to drink enough water daily to maintain proper hydration and overall health. The recommended daily water intake varies based on age, sex, weight, and activity level, but generally ranges from 8-10 cups (64-80 ounces) per day. (1,2)",

Methods: The cultural fair intelligence test was used to assess fluid intelligence in the participants of the DONALD study (n = 238; mean age, 16.5 [SD = 7.7] years). Urinary iodine excretion, a surrogate iodine intake marker, was measured in 24-h urine. Individual genetic disposition (n = 162) was assessed using a polygenic score, associated with general cognitive function. Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine whether Urinary iodine excretion was associated with fluid intelligence and whether this association was modified by individual genetic disposition. Results: Urinary iodine excretion above the age-specific estimated average requirement was associated with a five-point higher fluid intelligence score than that below the estimated average requirement (P = 0.02). The polygenic score was positively associated with the fluid intelligence score (\u03b2 = 2.3; P = 0.03). Participants with a higher polygenic score had a higher fluid intelligence score.

Results There were significant correlations of liver dysfunction (AST\u226535 IU, ALT\u226535 IU, \u03b3-GTP\u226575 IU), hypertension [systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) \u2265140/90 mmHg], and dyslipidemia (HDL <40 mg/dL) with the history/duration of homelessness (over 2 times/year) and residence status (living on the streets). Although the mean body mass index (BMI), BP, HbA1c, and LDL in participants living in temporary residences were similar to those obtained from the general population data from National Health Nutrition Survey (NHNS) 2016, the systolic/diastolic BP in those living on the street was significantly higher than in the general population, and the HDL in those living in temporary residences was significantly lower than in those reported in the NHNS 2016 data. In the group with cognitive disability, the ALT, TG, and BMI values were significantly higher and the HDL level significantly lower in those living in temporary residences than in those living on the streets. Conclusion Stressful conditions while living on the streets may exacerbate hypertension and liver dysfunction, and unhealthy food habits when living in a temporary residence may exacerbate low HDL levels. In addition, an inability to self-manage due to cognitive disability may increase the ALT, TG, and BMI values.

Years of monitoring results in Shanghai show the iodine status has approached the upper limit of the appropriate range for children aged 8-10 years, indicating a risk of iodine excess. We used multi-stage random sampling to select children. Sixteen districts of Shanghai were divided into five units based on geographic location, and one primary school was randomly selected from each unit. In each selected school, about 40 children aged 8-10 years were randomly recruited to measure their urinary iodine concentration (UIC), household salt iodine concentration (SIC), the score of the final unified exam of the last semester, and school canteen salt iodine concentration. The median UIC of 3213 children aged 8-10 years in Shanghai was 195.4 (122.0, 285.8) \u00b5g/L and exceeded 200 \u00b5g/L in 48.8% of the population. Household and school canteen iodized salt coverage rates were 60.3% and 82.5% respectively, and mean household and school canteen SICs were 21.51 \u00b1 9.30 mg/kg and 25.29 \u00b1 3.40 mg/kg respectively. By correcting for potential confounding factors, logistic regression demonstrated that compared to the adequate iodine status group, students in the slight iodine excess group were less likely to get \"A\" (score > 90) in math, Chinese, and English exams (Math: OR = 0.775, 95% CI = 0.660-0.911, P = 0.002; Chinese: OR = 0.707, 95% CI = 0.543-0.842, P < 0.001; English: OR = 0.720, 95% CI = 0.610-0.849, P < 0.001).

It is also associated with cognitive impairment in adults. Cognitive abilities are among the most inheritable behavioural traits. However, little is known about the consequences of insufficient postnatal iodine intake and whether the individual genetic disposition modifies the association between iodine intake and fluid intelligence in children and young adults. Methods: The cultural fair intelligence test was used to assess fluid intelligence in the participants of the DONALD study (n = 238; mean age, 16.5 [SD = 7.7] years). Urinary iodine excretion, a surrogate iodine intake marker, was measured in 24-h urine. Individual genetic disposition (n = 162) was assessed using a polygenic score, associated with general cognitive function. Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine whether Urinary iodine excretion was associated with fluid intelligence and whether this association was modified by individual genetic disposition. Results: Urinary iodine excretion above the age-specific estimated average requirement was associated with a five-point higher fluid intelligence score than that below the estimated average requirement (P = 0.02). The polygenic score was positively associated with the fluid intelligence score (\u03b2 = 2.3; P = 0.03). Participants with a higher polygenic score had a higher fluid intelligence score. Conclusion: Urinary iodine excretion above the estimated average requirement in childhood and adolescence is beneficial for fluid intelligence. In adults, fluid intelligence was positively associated with a polygenic score for general cognitive function. No evidence showed that the individual genetic disposition modifies the association between Urinary iodine excretion and fluid intelligence.",

In the group with cognitive disability, the ALT, TG, and BMI values were significantly higher and the HDL level significantly lower in those living in temporary residences than in those living on the streets. Conclusion Stressful conditions while living on the streets may exacerbate hypertension and liver dysfunction, and unhealthy food habits when living in a temporary residence may exacerbate low HDL levels. In addition, an inability to self-manage due to cognitive disability may increase the ALT, TG, and BMI values. The provision of homeless people with the skills to sustain independent living conditions and ensure a healthy diet is required.",

        "answer": "Healio: The health effects of living in a highly polluted area can vary depending on the type and level of pollution. Exposure to high levels of air pollution, such as particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), can lead to respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and other health problems.\n\nIn addition, exposure to heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, can have serious health effects, including reductions in intelligence, behavioral problems, and increased risk of cancer. Lead exposure can also cause skin changes, such as kidney damage and anemia, and can affect fetal development during pregnancy.\n\nThe impact of pollution on mental health is also a growing concern. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders.\n\nIt's important to note that the effects of pollution can vary depending on factors such as age, health status, and the level of exposure. Children, pregnant women, and older adults are often more susceptible to the health effects of pollution due to their developing bodies and increased sensitivity to pollutants.\n\nOverall, living in a highly polluted area can have significant negative impacts on both physical and mental health. It's important to take steps to reduce exposure to pollution, such as using air purifiers, avoiding heavily polluted areas, and advocating for policies that promote clean air and water.",

Housing characteristics are associated with human health while environmental chemicals could have mediated the effects. However, it is unclear if and how residence duration might have a role in health and well-being. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations among residence duration, common chronic diseases, and cognitive function in older adults in a national and population-based setting. Data were extracted from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002, with assessment information on demographics, lifestyle factors, housing characteristics, self-reported common chronic diseases, and cognitive function by using the digit symbol substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (a measurement of attention and psychomotor speed). Statistical analyses including the chi-square test, t test, and survey-weighted general linear modeling and logistic regression modeling were performed. Residence duration was significantly associated with risk of asthma but not with other chronic disease, showing a longer stay in the same housing leading to lower risk of asthma (OR 0.43, 95%CI 0.27-0.69, P = 0.002) among the American older adults. However, having asthma was not associated with cognitive function decline. In conclusion, residence duration was found to be associated with risk of asthma but not cognitive function. Future research examining the relationship of residence duration and cognitive tests by other domains of cognitive function following asthma episodes would be suggested. For practice and policy implications, familiarity with the housing environment might help with lessening respiratory symptoms.",

Hazardous waste problems are especially severe in lower income Asian countries where environmental regulations are non-existent, nonspecific or poorly enforced. In these countries extensive unregulated industrial development has created waste sites in densely populated urban areas. These sites appear to pose significant risks to public health, and especially to the health of children. To assess potential health risks from chemical contamination at hazardous waste sites in Asia, we assessed 679 sites. A total of 169 sites in 7 countries were classified as contaminated by lead. Eighty-two of these sites contained lead at levels high enough to produce elevated blood lead levels in surrounding populations. To estimate the burden of pediatric lead poisoning associated with exposure to lead in soil and water at these 82 lead-contaminated sites, we used standard toxicokinetic models that relate levels of lead in soil and water to blood lead levels in children. We calculated blood lead levels, and we quantified losses of intelligence (reductions in IQ scores) that were attributable to lead exposure at these sites. We found that 189,725 children in the 7 countries are at risk of diminished intelligence as a consequence of exposure to elevated levels of lead in water and soil at hazardous waste sites. Depending on choice of model, these decrements ranged from 4.94 to 14.96 IQ points. Given the restricted scope of this survey and the conservative estimation procedures employed, this number is almost certainly an underestimate of the full burden of disease. Exposure to toxic chemicals from hazardous waste sites is an important and heretofore insufficiently examined contributor to the Global Burden of Disease.",

We compared current with recommended exposure levels, quantified the association between exposures and mortality and calculated attributable health impact fractions. Eight percent of premature mortality (i.e. 1239 deaths, 95% CI: 679-1784) was estimated to be attributable to non-compliance with the recommended exposure levels. Seventy-six percent of the attributable premature mortality was due to PM2.5 exposure and insufficient PA. Non-compliance also resulted in an average of 199 days of LE lost for the adult population (95% CI: 111-280) and an economic impact of 4.6 (95% CI: 2.5-6.7) billion 2015\u20ac annually. Overall, residents of lower SES neighbourhoods faced higher risk of premature mortality due to higher exposure to NO2, road traffic noise, heat and less green space. Despite high liveability standards according to EIU definition, a considerable premature mortality burden was attributable to non-compliance with exposure recommendations, and socioeconomic inequalities were estimated. Although the exposure attributable mortality burden was lower than in other European cities and local Viennese policies favour the reduction of motorized traffic, alongside the promotion of active and public transport and urban greening, there is room for further alignment of liveability, environmental health and justice objectives.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations among residence duration, common chronic diseases, and cognitive function in older adults in a national and population-based setting. Data were extracted from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002, with assessment information on demographics, lifestyle factors, housing characteristics, self-reported common chronic diseases, and cognitive function by using the digit symbol substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (a measurement of attention and psychomotor speed). Statistical analyses including the chi-square test, t test, and survey-weighted general linear modeling and logistic regression modeling were performed. Residence duration was significantly associated with risk of asthma but not with other chronic disease, showing a longer stay in the same housing leading to lower risk of asthma (OR 0.43, 95%CI 0.27-0.69, P = 0.002) among the American older adults. However, having asthma was not associated with cognitive function decline. In conclusion, residence duration was found to be associated with risk of asthma but not cognitive function.

                    "abstract": "Each year, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) computes the Global Liveability Index and determines the most liveable cities around the world. Vienna, Austria, was ranked by the EIU as the most liveable city worldwide in 2018 and 2019. However, the relationship between a liveable as well as healthy and environmentally-just city has not been previously explored. To explore whether the most liveable city is also a healthy and environmentally-just one, we estimated the premature mortality burden related to non-compliance with international exposure level recommendations for physical activity (PA), air pollution (PM2.5 and NO2), road traffic noise, green space and heat for Vienna, as well as its distribution by socioeconomic status (SES). We applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) methodology and estimated the annual mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic impact of non-compliance with exposure guidelines for the Viennese adult population \u2265 20 years. We compared current with recommended exposure levels, quantified the association between exposures and mortality and calculated attributable health impact fractions. Eight percent of premature mortality (i.e. 1239 deaths, 95% CI: 679-1784) was estimated to be attributable to non-compliance with the recommended exposure levels. Seventy-six percent of the attributable premature mortality was due to PM2.5 exposure and insufficient PA. Non-compliance also resulted in an average of 199 days of LE lost for the adult population (95% CI: 111-280) and an economic impact of 4.6 (95% CI: 2.5-6.7) billion 2015\u20ac annually. Overall, residents of lower SES neighbourhoods faced higher risk of premature mortality due to higher exposure to NO2, road traffic noise, heat and less green space. Despite high liveability standards according to EIU definition, a considerable premature mortality burden was attributable to non-compliance with exposure recommendations, and socioeconomic inequalities were estimated. Although the exposure attributable mortality burden was lower than in other European cities and local Viennese policies favour the reduction of motorized traffic, alongside the promotion of active and public transport and urban greening, there is room for further alignment of liveability, environmental health and justice objectives.",

These sites appear to pose significant risks to public health, and especially to the health of children. To assess potential health risks from chemical contamination at hazardous waste sites in Asia, we assessed 679 sites. A total of 169 sites in 7 countries were classified as contaminated by lead. Eighty-two of these sites contained lead at levels high enough to produce elevated blood lead levels in surrounding populations. To estimate the burden of pediatric lead poisoning associated with exposure to lead in soil and water at these 82 lead-contaminated sites, we used standard toxicokinetic models that relate levels of lead in soil and water to blood lead levels in children. We calculated blood lead levels, and we quantified losses of intelligence (reductions in IQ scores) that were attributable to lead exposure at these sites. We found that 189,725 children in the 7 countries are at risk of diminished intelligence as a consequence of exposure to elevated levels of lead in water and soil at hazardous waste sites. Depending on choice of model, these decrements ranged from 4.94 to 14.96 IQ points.

        "answer": "Healio: The recommended vaccination schedule is crucial for protecting individuals against infectious diseases. Failure to follow the recommended vaccination schedule can lead to several consequences, including:\n\n1. Increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases: If a person doesn't receive the recommended vaccines according to the schedule, they may be at a higher risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and influenza.\n2. Delayed protection: Vaccines are most effective when given at specific ages and intervals. Delaying vaccination can result in delayed protection, leaving the individual more susceptible to infection.\n3. Increased disease transmission: When a significant portion of the population is not vaccinated, it can lead to increased transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases, potentially causing outbreaks and epidemics.\n4. Complications and hospitalizations: Vaccine-preventable diseases can lead to severe complications, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and encephalitis, which can result in hospitalizations and even death.\n5. Economic burden: Vaccine-preventable diseases can also lead to significant economic burdens, including lost productivity, medical expenses, and societal costs.\n\nIt is essential to follow the recommended vaccination schedule to ensure optimal protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. If you have any concerns or questions about the vaccination schedule, consult with your healthcare provider.",

Many women do not receive vaccines recommended during pregnancy; conversely, inadvertent exposure to vaccines contraindicated or not recommended during pregnancy may occur. We assessed exposure to two recommended vaccines and two vaccines not recommended during pregnancy among privately and Medicaid-insured women in the United States. Methods: This study includes a retrospective cohort of pregnancies in women aged 12-55 years resulting in live birth, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth identified in the IBM\u00ae MarketScan\u00ae Commercial, Blue Health Intelligence\u00ae (BHI\u00ae) Commercial, and IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Databases from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

                    "abstract": "Background: Despite the availability of free routine immunizations in low- and middle-income countries, many children are not completely vaccinated, vaccinated late for age, or drop out from the course of the immunization schedule. Without the technology to model and visualize risk of large datasets, vaccinators and policy makers are unable to identify target groups and individuals at high risk of dropping out; thus default rates remain high, preventing universal immunization coverage. Predictive analytics algorithm leverages artificial intelligence and uses statistical modeling, machine learning, and multidimensional data mining to accurately identify children who are most likely to delay or miss their follow-up immunization visits. Objective: This study aimed to conduct feasibility testing and validation of a predictive analytics algorithm to identify the children who are likely to default on subsequent immunization visits for any vaccine included in the routine immunization schedule. Methods: The algorithm was developed using 47,554 longitudinal immunization records, which were classified into the training and validation cohorts. Four machine learning models (random forest; recursive partitioning; support vector machines, SVMs; and C-forest) were used to generate the algorithm that predicts the likelihood of each child defaulting from the follow-up immunization visit. The following variables were used in the models as predictors of defaulting: gender of the child, language spoken at the child's house, place of residence of the child (town or city), enrollment vaccine, timeliness of vaccination, enrolling staff (vaccinator or others), date of birth (accurate or estimated), and age group of the child. The models were encapsulated in the predictive engine, which identified the most appropriate method to use in a given case. Each of the models was assessed in terms of accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: Out of 11,889 cases in the validation dataset, the random forest model correctly predicted 8994 cases, yielding 94.9% sensitivity and 54.9% specificity. The C-forest model, SVMs, and recursive partitioning models improved prediction by achieving 352, 376, and 389 correctly predicted cases, respectively, above the predictions made by the random forest model. All models had a C-statistic of 0.750 or above, whereas the highest statistic (AUC 0.791, 95% CI 0.784-0.798) was observed in the recursive partitioning algorithm. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrates that predictive analytics can accurately identify children who are at a higher risk for defaulting on follow-up immunization visits. Correct identification of potential defaulters opens a window for evidence-based targeted interventions in resource limited settings to achieve optimal immunization coverage and timeliness.",

Without the technology to model and visualize risk of large datasets, vaccinators and policy makers are unable to identify target groups and individuals at high risk of dropping out; thus default rates remain high, preventing universal immunization coverage. Predictive analytics algorithm leverages artificial intelligence and uses statistical modeling, machine learning, and multidimensional data mining to accurately identify children who are most likely to delay or miss their follow-up immunization visits. Objective: This study aimed to conduct feasibility testing and validation of a predictive analytics algorithm to identify the children who are likely to default on subsequent immunization visits for any vaccine included in the routine immunization schedule. Methods: The algorithm was developed using 47,554 longitudinal immunization records, which were classified into the training and validation cohorts. Four machine learning models (random forest; recursive partitioning; support vector machines, SVMs; and C-forest) were used to generate the algorithm that predicts the likelihood of each child defaulting from the follow-up immunization visit. The following variables were used in the models as predictors of defaulting: gender of the child, language spoken at the child's house, place of residence of the child (town or city), enrollment vaccine, timeliness of vaccination, enrolling staff (vaccinator or others), date of birth (accurate or estimated), and age group of the child. The models were encapsulated in the predictive engine, which identified the most appropriate method to use in a given case. Each of the models was assessed in terms of accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: Out of 11,889 cases in the validation dataset, the random forest model correctly predicted 8994 cases, yielding 94.9% sensitivity and 54.9% specificity. The C-forest model, SVMs, and recursive partitioning models improved prediction by achieving 352, 376, and 389 correctly predicted cases, respectively, above the predictions made by the random forest model. All models had a C-statistic of 0.750 or above, whereas the highest statistic (AUC 0.791, 95% CI 0.784-0.798) was observed in the recursive partitioning algorithm. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrates that predictive analytics can accurately identify children who are at a higher risk for defaulting on follow-up immunization visits. Correct identification of potential defaulters opens a window for evidence-based targeted interventions in resource limited settings to achieve optimal immunization coverage and timeliness.",

However, they were not informed that emergency departments (EDs) were safe. Reports from the National Ambulance Services showed a 22% increase in at-home deaths during the lockdown. Perhaps, the reason is because some critically ill patients postponed referrals and came \"at the last minute\". After the first lockdown, the Ministry of Health (MOH) declared that hospital EDs were safe. The objective of the study was to examine the rates of admission from EDs to hospital wards, and non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths during the first lockdown in Israel, compared with the second and third lockdowns. From the business intelligence software of the Rambam Medical Center in Israel, we collected data about the rates of admission to the ED, the non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths during the three lockdowns, during the same periods in the previous three years, and the main five causes of non-COVID-19 deaths. Data comparison was done using multiple chi-square tests. ED admission numbers were significantly higher during the first lockdown than during the second (\u03c72 (1, n = 36,245) = 24.774, p = 0.00001) and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (1, n = 36,547) = 8.7808, p = 0.0030). We found a significantly higher number of non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths vs. discharges during the first lockdown than in the second and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (2, n = 26,268) = 7.794, p = 0.0203) The number of deaths due to respiratory diseases was significantly higher during the first lockdown than in the second lockdown (\u03c72 (1, n = 572) = 8.8185, p = 0.0029) and in the third lockdown (\u03c72 (1, n = 624) = 9.0381, p = 0.0026), and deaths from infectious diseases were higher during the first lockdown than during both the second and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (1, n = 566) = 5.9479, p = 0.0147, and \u03c72 (1, n = 624) = 9.5978, p = 0.0019), respectively. The onset of CVA and CVD are abrupt, while respiratory and infectious diseases may have an insidious pattern; this may have led patients to postpone referrals to hospitals to the \"last minute\" during the first lockdown, perhaps due to fears of contracting COVID-19, and as a result of vague instructions. Citizens and policymakers must be made aware of this point during future pandemics.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence-powered voice assistants (VAs), such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa, interact with users in natural language and are capable of responding to simple commands, searching the internet, and answering questions. Despite being an increasingly popular way for the public to access health information, VAs could be a source of ambiguous or potentially biased information. Objective: In response to the ongoing prevalence of vaccine misinformation and disinformation, this study aims to evaluate how smartphone VAs respond to information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of English-speaking adults who owned a smartphone with a VA installed was conducted online from April 22 to 28, 2021. The primary outcomes were the VAs' responses to 2 questions: \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" and \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" Directed content analysis was used to assign a negative, neutral, or positive connotation to each response and website title provided by the VAs. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (nonparametric) test for continuous variables and the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Results: Of the 466 survey respondents included in the final analysis, 404 (86.7%) used Apple Siri, 53 (11.4%) used Google Assistant, and 9 (1.9%) used Amazon Alexa. In response to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" 419 (89.9%) users received a direct response, of which 408 (97.3%) had a positive connotation encouraging users to get vaccinated. Of the websites presented, only 5.3% (11/207) had a positive connotation and 94.7% (196/207) had a neutral connotation. In response to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" 93.1% (434/466) of users received a list of websites, of which 91.5% (1155/1262) had a neutral connotation. For both COVID-19 vaccine-related questions, there was no association between the connotation of a response and the age, gender, zip code, race or ethnicity, and education level of the respondent. Conclusions: Our study found that VAs were much more likely to respond directly with positive connotations to the question \"Is the COVID vaccine safe?\" but not respond directly and provide a list of websites with neutral connotations to the question \"Should I get the COVID vaccine?\" To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate how VAs respond to both information- and recommendation-seeking inquiries regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings add to our growing understanding of both the opportunities and pitfalls of VAs in supporting public health information dissemination.",

        "answer": "Healio: According to a study published in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, starting a high-intensity workout routine without prior physical training can lead to muscle fatigue and injury. The study found that novice exercisers who performed high-intensity interval training (HIIT) experienced increased muscle fatigue and decreased peak power output compared to those who performed moderate-intensity continuous training. Additionally, the study noted that incorrect postures during exercise can lead to abnormal muscle activation, joint strain, and ineffective sessions or even injuries. It is important for individuals without prior physical training to start with low-intensity exercises and gradually progress to higher-intensity activities to avoid injury and maximize the benefits of exercise.

Methods: Fifty-four persons with intellectual disabilities (age: 17 (3.0), body mass index: 27.7 (3.7), intelligence quotient: 59 (8.6)) were matched based on age, gender and intelligence quotient between sprint interval training (n = 17), continuous aerobic training (n = 15) and control (n = 14). Sprint interval training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes at ventilatory threshold (blocks 1 and 3: 10 sprint bouts of 15 seconds, followed by 45 seconds relative rest; block 2: continuous training) twice a week for 15 weeks. Continuous aerobic training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes continuous training. After eight weeks, intensity was increased to 110% of ventilatory threshold. The control group did not participate in supervised exercise training. Before and after the training period, body composition, physical and metabolic fitness were evaluated. Results: Sprint interval training showed a significant positive evolution for waist circumference, fat%, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, peak VO2, peak Watt, ventilatory threshold, 6-minute walk distance and muscle fatigue resistance when compared with no training (P < 0.01). The sprint interval training group demonstrated significant improvements for fat%, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, fasting insulin, peak VO2 and peak power and ventilatory threshold (P < 0.01) when compared with continuous aerobic training. Conclusion: In this study we could observe that sprint interval training has stronger beneficial effects on body composition, physical fitness and metabolic fitness compared with control. Compared with continuous aerobic training, sprint interval training seems to result in better outcome.",

Methods: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles up to August 2022. Eligible studies assessed the effects of HIIT (70%-100% VO2max ) and/or SIT (\u2265100% VO2max ) on cognitive function test scores in cognitively healthy adults, relative to a control or comparative exercise group/condition. Data on participant characteristics, exercise protocol, key outcomes, and intervention setting were extracted. Study quality was assessed using a 9 (single session HIIT/SIT) and 14 (multiple session HIIT/SIT) item checklist. Results: Thirty-six studies (15 countries; n = 11-945 participants) met inclusion criteria. Mean quality scores were \"fair-to-good\" for acute (single session; mean = 6.9 [SD 1.0]) and chronic (multiple session; mean = 9.8 [SD 1.6]) training studies. Eighteen from 36 studies (12/20 [55%] acute and 6/16 [38%] chronic training studies) evidenced significant improvements in aspects of cognitive function related to work performance (i.e., attention, inhibition, memory, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility, intelligence, reaction time, and learning). Only four studies tested the impact of HIIT/SIT on cognitive function in a work-based setting (e.g., the office or home). Conclusions: While there is promising evidence, particularly from acute training studies, to indicate that high intensity, short duration exercise benefits cognitive function in adults, there is very limited evidence of application in workplace contexts. To better understand the potential benefits to employee performance and safety, HIIT/SIT and cognitive function research needs to transition from laboratory to \"in-situ\" occupational settings.",

Abdominal fat was assessed pre- and post-intervention; executive function (Coding subtest from BETA-III non-verbal intelligence test and Stroop Color and Word Test), concentrations of mBDNF and proBDNF were assessed in response to acute exercise pre- and post-intervention. Abdominal fat did not change in either group. There was a significant increase in mBDNF immediately after acute exercise in both groups before and after intervention. proBDNF did not present changes acutely nor after 6 weeks. Executive function presented a main effect of time at pre- and post-intervention time-points Stroop Word and Stroop Color and Coding subtest presented improved performance from pre- to post-acute exercise session, in both groups.

                    "abstract": "Background: Insufficient physical activity due to social distancing and suppressed outdoor activities increases vulnerability to diseases like cardiovascular diseases, sarcopenia, and severe COVID-19. While bodyweight exercises, such as squats, effectively boost physical activity, incorrect postures risk abnormal muscle activation joint strain, leading to ineffective sessions or even injuries. Avoiding incorrect postures is challenging for novices without expert guidance. Existing solutions for remote coaching and computer-assisted posture correction often prove costly or inefficient. Objective: This study aimed to use deep neural networks to develop a personal workout assistant that offers feedback on squat postures using only mobile devices-smartphones and tablets. Deep learning mimicked experts' visual assessments of proper exercise postures. The effectiveness of the mobile app was evaluated by comparing it with exercise videos, a popular at-home workout choice. Methods: Twenty participants were recruited without squat exercise experience and divided into an experimental group (EXP) with 10 individuals aged 21.90 (SD 2.18) years and a mean BMI of 20.75 (SD 2.11) and a control group (CTL) with 10 individuals aged 22.60 (SD 1.95) years and a mean BMI of 18.72 (SD 1.23) using randomized controlled trials. A data set with over 20,000 squat videos annotated by experts was created and a deep learning model was trained using pose estimation and video classification to analyze the workout postures. Subsequently, a mobile workout assistant app, Home Alone Exercise, was developed, and a 2-week interventional study, in which the EXP used the app while the CTL only followed workout videos, showed how the app helps people improve squat exercise. Results: The EXP significantly improved their squat postures evaluated by the app after 2 weeks (Pre: 0.20 vs Mid: 4.20 vs Post: 8.00, P=.001), whereas the CTL (without the app) showed no significant change in squat posture (Pre: 0.70 vs Mid: 1.30 vs Post: 3.80, P=.13). Significant differences were observed in the left (Pre: 75.06 vs Mid: 76.24 vs Post: 63.13, P=.02) and right (Pre: 71.99 vs Mid: 76.68 vs Post: 62.82, P=.03) knee joint angles in the EXP before and after exercise, with no significant effect found for the CTL in the left (Pre: 73.27 vs Mid: 74.05 vs Post: 70.70, P=.68) and right (Pre: 70.82 vs Mid: 74.02 vs Post: 70.23, P=.61) knee joint angles. Conclusions: EXP participants trained with the app experienced faster improvement and learned more nuanced details of the squat exercise. The proposed mobile app, offering cost-effective self-discovery feedback, effectively taught users about squat exercises without expensive in-person trainer sessions.

Methods: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles up to August 2022. Eligible studies assessed the effects of HIIT (70%-100% VO2max ) and/or SIT (\u2265100% VO2max ) on cognitive function test scores in cognitively healthy adults, relative to a control or comparative exercise group/condition. Data on participant characteristics, exercise protocol, key outcomes, and intervention setting were extracted. Study quality was assessed using a 9 (single session HIIT/SIT) and 14 (multiple session HIIT/SIT) item checklist. Results: Thirty-six studies (15 countries; n = 11-945 participants) met inclusion criteria. Mean quality scores were \"fair-to-good\" for acute (single session; mean = 6.9 [SD 1.0]) and chronic (multiple session; mean = 9.8 [SD 1.6]) training studies. Eighteen from 36 studies (12/20 [55%] acute and 6/16 [38%] chronic training studies) evidenced significant improvements in aspects of cognitive function related to work performance (i.e., attention, inhibition, memory, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility, intelligence, reaction time, and learning). Only four studies tested the impact of HIIT/SIT on cognitive function in a work-based setting (e.g., the office or home). Conclusions: While there is promising evidence, particularly from acute training studies, to indicate that high intensity, short duration exercise benefits cognitive function in adults, there is very limited evidence of application in workplace contexts. To better understand the potential benefits to employee performance and safety, HIIT/SIT and cognitive function research needs to transition from laboratory to \"in-situ\" occupational settings.",

Sprint interval training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes at ventilatory threshold (blocks 1 and 3: 10 sprint bouts of 15 seconds, followed by 45 seconds relative rest; block 2: continuous training) twice a week for 15 weeks. Continuous aerobic training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes continuous training. After eight weeks, intensity was increased to 110% of ventilatory threshold. The control group did not participate in supervised exercise training. Before and after the training period, body composition, physical and metabolic fitness were evaluated. Results: Sprint interval training showed a significant positive evolution for waist circumference, fat%, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, peak VO2, peak Watt, ventilatory threshold, 6-minute walk distance and muscle fatigue resistance when compared with no training (P < 0.01). The sprint interval training group demonstrated significant improvements for fat%, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, fasting insulin, peak VO2 and peak power and ventilatory threshold (P < 0.01) when compared with continuous aerobic training.

Significant interaction effects were observed with grip strength, RSMI, L3 SMD, and L3 SMA. At the 24th week, participants' grip strength, L3 SMFA, L3 SMA, and RSMI were improved significantly in the SDSG and STG. The SDSG achieved significantly greater RSMI and grip strength than the STG and CG after the intervention.

        "answer": "Healio:  The combination of a sedentary lifestyle and a high-sugar diet has been shown to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance, which is the decreased ability of insulin to facilitate glucose uptake in the body's cells. This can cause glucose levels to rise, leading to hyperglycemia. Additionally, a high-sugar diet can also contribute to insulin resistance, as consuming high amounts of sugar can lead to increased glucose production in the liver, further contributing to hyperglycemia. The combination of these two factors can exacerbate insulin resistance and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. (Based on the information found in the PubMed abstracts)",

Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association. Results: Each increase of 100 kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: - 0.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion. However, it seems that other mechanisms may explain the association between sugar consumption and development of type 2 diabetes.",

Methods: Using regression models and general structural equation models, we examined the cross-sectional association between type 2 diabetes status and: fluid intelligence; reaction time; visual memory; digit span and prospective memory; and the hypothesised mediating role of common comorbid conditions: visceral obesity; sleep problems; macrovascular problems; respiratory problems; cancer and depressive symptoms in 47,468 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, of whom 1,831 have type 2 diabetes. We controlled for ethnicity, sex, age, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels and use of diabetes medication. Results: Participants with type 2 diabetes had a significantly shorter digit span, b = -0.14, CIs [-0.27, -0.11] than those without type 2 diabetes. Those with type 2 diabetes did not differ from those without type 2 diabetes on fluid intelligence, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory. The associations that do exist between type 2 diabetes and cognition are consistently mediated via macrovascular problems, depressive symptoms, and to a lesser extent visceral obesity. Respiratory problems, sleep disturbances and cancer did not mediate the association between type 2 diabetes status and measures of cognition. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions explain some of the observed association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive deficits. This suggests that prevention, management or treatment of these comorbid conditions may be important to reduce the likelihood of cognitive decline.

In this study, we collected gut microbiome activity data by assessing the metatranscriptome, and we measured the glycemic responses of 550 adults who consumed more than 30,000 meals, collectively, from omnivore or vegetarian/gluten-free diets. We demonstrate that gut microbiome activity, anthropometric factors, and food macronutrients modulate individual variation in glycemic response. We employ two predictive models, including a mixed-effects linear regression model (R = 0.77) and a gradient boosting machine model (Rtrain = 0.80/R2train = 0.64; Rtest = 0.64/R2test = 0.40), which demonstrate variation in PPGR between individuals when ingesting the same foods. All features in the final mixed-effects linear regression model were significant (p < 0.05) except for two features which were retained as suggestive: glutamine production pathways (p = 0.08) and the interaction between tyrosine metabolizers and carbs (p = 0.06). We introduce molecular functions as features in these two models, aggregated from microbial activity data, and show their statistically significant contributions to glycemic control. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that metatranscriptomic activity of the gut microbiome is correlated with PPGR among adults.",

        "answer": "Healio: The long-term effects of consistently getting less sleep than the recommended amount can have significant impacts on a person's health. Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairments, including difficulties with attention, memory, and decision-making. Additionally, chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nResearch has also suggested that sleep deprivation can contribute to the development of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. For example, one study found that older individuals who consistently got less than 7 hours of sleep per night were more likely to experience cognitive decline over a 10-year period.\n\nFurthermore, chronic sleep deprivation can also impact mental health, increasing the risk of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. It can also lead to changes in brain structure and function, including reductions in the volume of certain brain regions.\n\nIt is important to prioritize getting enough sleep each night to maintain optimal health. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. If you are consistently having trouble sleeping, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare provider to identify underlying causes and develop strategies for improving sleep quality.",

This study aimed to investigate whether older insomnia sufferers demonstrate significantly impaired performance on a challenging working memory task when compared with age-matched good sleepers. Forty-nine older individuals (mean age = 69.43 years, SD = 4.83) suffering from sleep maintenance insomnia were compared with 49 age-matched good sleepers. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Double Span Memory Task, a computer-based working memory task that requires participants to indicate the names and/or spatial locations of increasingly longer sequences of visually presented objects. After controlling for general intelligence, the individuals suffering from insomnia did not perform differently when compared with the good sleepers on either the simpler or more cognitively demanding components of the task. Older individuals with insomnia did not display an observable impairment of working memory in this study relative to good sleepers.

Recent neuro-imaging studies have demonstrated frontal lobe hypo-activation among insomniac populations when compared with healthy, good sleepers. However, research is yet to confirm whether frontal lobe hypo-activation translates into objective declines when performing tasks hypothesized to draw upon this brain region. This study aimed to investigate whether older insomnia sufferers demonstrate significantly impaired performance on a challenging working memory task when compared with age-matched good sleepers. Forty-nine older individuals (mean age = 69.43 years, SD = 4.83) suffering from sleep maintenance insomnia were compared with 49 age-matched good sleepers. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Double Span Memory Task, a computer-based working memory task that requires participants to indicate the names and/or spatial locations of increasingly longer sequences of visually presented objects. After controlling for general intelligence, the individuals suffering from insomnia did not perform differently when compared with the good sleepers on either the simpler or more cognitively demanding components of the task. Older individuals with insomnia did not display an observable impairment of working memory in this study relative to good sleepers. Despite the mixed results from previous research, this study adds weight to the absence of objective impairment in insomniacs, at least while performing short-term demanding cognitive tasks.",

Our aim was to investigate interrelations between subjective sleep-related symptoms, obesity, cardiometabolic disorders, brain structure and cognitive decline in a population-based aging sample. Methods: Data were extracted from the UK Biobank for anthropometric and demographic information, self-reported sleep behaviours, cardiometabolic measures, structural brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive test scores. \"Sleep-related symptoms\" (SRS) were measured using four questionnaire items: loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, likelihood to nap and difficulty getting up in the morning. Associations were tested using a structural equation model (SEM), adjusted for confounders. Further, multiple regression analysis was used to test for direct relationships between SRS and specific cognitive domains. Results: Among 36,468 participants with an average age of 63.6 (SD 7.5) years and 46.7% male, we found that SRS were associated with obesity and several pre-existing cardiometabolic disturbances. In turn, cardiometabolic disorders were associated with increased white matter hyperintensities and cortical thinning, which were related to cognitive dysfunction. SRS were also directly related to several structural brain changes and to cognitive dysfunction. Regression analyses showed that SRS were directly associated with slower reaction times, and lower scores in fluid intelligence, working memory and executive function. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep-related symptoms were associated with cognitive dysfunction directly and through pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders and brain structural alterations.

Methods: We analyzed data from 1190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database. Participants were grouped on whether they reported habitual short (\u22646 hours) vs. medium length (7-9 hours) sleep duration and whether they perceived daytime dysfunction using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: All short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers, regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined, self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1190 participants. Conclusions: Individuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore, there is a reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction, in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity, than they may assume. Current findings suggest that assessment of sleep duration over the prior month has meaningful predictive utility for human reward-related impulsivity.",

        "answer": "Healio: According to the literature, chronic stress can negatively impact the immune system by increasing inflammation and reducing immune function. This can make individuals more susceptible to illness. The reasons for this remain speculative, but it is possible that the effects are caused by sample selectiveness (i.e., membership in a high-IQ society) rather than high IQ itself. Additionally, emerging evidence regarding COVID-19 highlights the role of individual resistance and immune function in both susceptibility to infection and severity of disease.\n\nNutritional status, physical and psychosocial stressors, obesity, protein-calorie malnutrition, emotional resilience, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, environmental toxins including air pollution and firsthand and secondhand tobacco smoke, sleep habits, sedentary lifestyle, drug-induced nutritional deficiencies and drug-induced immunomodulatory effects, and availability of nutrient-dense food and empty calories can all influence an individual's susceptibility to infection. Improving intrapersonal emotional skills may improve function of the immune system and reduce the symptoms of depression, and targeted improvement of interpersonal skills (empathy) on depression.\n\nFurther studies are needed to examine the effect of targeted improvement of interpersonal skills (empathy) on depression. The symptoms of a weakened immune system (WIMS) were assessed by measurements of permanent tiredness, frequent infections and colds, slow wound healing, persistent and recurrent diarrhea, recurring herpes, insomnia and difficulty sleeping, and dry eyes.\n\nIt is possible that even minor increases in chron",

However, recent findings have claimed that exceptional intelligence may come at a cost. Individuals at the upmost end of the intelligence distribution are reported to be disproportionately afflicted by a set of stress-related physical and mental health conditions: so-called overexcitabilities. Few accounts have investigated this issue and no studies are available for non-US samples yet. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend previous work by examining hitherto unaddressed overexcitabilities in a European high-IQ sample. Methods: We carried out a preregistered survey among members of MENSA, the world's largest high-IQ society. In total, 615 (307 male) members from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom participated. Results and discussion: Compared to the general population, our sample exhibited considerably elevated prevalences in autism spectrum disorders (risk ratio/RR = 2.25), chronic fatigue syndrome (RR = 5.69), depression (RR = 4.38), generalized anxiety (RR = 3.82), and irritable bowel syndrome (RR = 3.76). Contrary to previous accounts, neither asthma, allergies, nor autoimmune diseases were elevated. We show that this subsample of intellectually gifted persons faces specific health challenges compared to the general population. The reasons for this remain speculative, as we find little evidence for previously proposed immunological explanations. However, it is possible that the effects are caused by sample selectiveness (i.e., membership in a high-IQ society) rather than high IQ itself.",

In this study, we used a combination of psychometric scales to examine the relationships of depression with emotional intelligence (intrapersonal and interpersonal), empathy (affective and cognitive), and symptoms of weakened immune system. Methods: This cross-sectional prospective study examined 158 volunteers (39 males and 119 females). A score of 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to define depression. The Cognitive and Affective Empathy Test (TECA) was used to assess empathy, and the Profile of Emotional Competence (PEC) was used to assess the self-perception of intrapersonal and interpersonal competence. The symptoms of a weakened immune system (WIS) were assessed by measurements of permanent tiredness, frequent infections and colds, slow wound healing, persistent and recurrent diarrhea, recurring herpes, insomnia and difficulty sleeping, and dry eyes. Results: The total PEC score and intrapersonal PEC score had negative correlations with depression, and the WIS score had a positive correlation with depression. The TECA score had no significant correlation with depression or the WIS score, but had positive correlations with the total PEC score, intrapersonal PEC score, and interpersonal PEC score. Conclusion: The total PEC score, intrapersonal PEC score, and WIS score were significantly associated with depression. The TECA score was not significantly associated with depression or the WIS score. Our findings suggest that improving intrapersonal emotional skills may improve function of the immune system and reduce the symptoms of depression. We suggest that further studies examine the effect of targeted improvement of interpersonal skills (empathy) on depression.",

        "answer": "Healio: High blood pressure (BP) is a significant risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease (CKD). Studies have consistently shown that elevated BP is associated with an increased risk of CKD incidence, progression, and mortality. In fact, hypertension is estimated to be responsible for up to 50% of all CKD cases worldwide. This is because high BP can cause damage to the kidneys' tiny blood vessels, leading to scarring, inflammation, and loss of kidney function. Additionally, hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is also a leading cause of CKD mortality. Therefore, managing BP through lifestyle modifications and medication is crucial for the prevention and treatment of CKD.",

Furthermore, progress in big data is stimulating the flourishing of artificial intelligence (AI), which is an excellent tool for handling, and subsequently processing, a great amount of data and may be applied to highlight more information on the effectiveness of medicine in kidney-related complications for the purpose of more precise phenotype and outcome prediction. In this article, we discuss the advances and challenges in big data, the use of EHRs and AI, with great emphasis on the usage of nephrology and transplantation.",

Data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study demonstrate a risk for impairment of EF, a finding associated with heightened blood pressure variability (BPV). We sought to determine whether low serum bicarbonate is also associated with performance on tests of EF in pediatric CKD and to investigate potential interaction with BPV. Methods: CKiD participants with serum bicarbonate, blood pressure, and selected cognitive measurements available were evaluated. An EF summary score was derived from scores on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Conners' Continuous Performance Test, and Digit Span Backwards subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV-Integrated. Parents completed the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to yield a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score. Linear mixed models with bicarbonate and hypertension as predictors and linear regression with bicarbonate and BPV were used to predict EF level. Results: Data were available for 865 children. Twenty-two percent had low bicarbonate (CO2 \u2264 20 mmol/L) at baseline. On multivariate analysis, there was no relationship between bicarbonate, hypertension, and EF. There was no significant CO2\u00d7hypertension interaction found. A significant interaction (p = 0.01) between high CO2 (\u2265 26 mmol/L) and BPV was detected in the model with GEC as the EF outcome, indicating that while higher BPV was associated with worse EF in the low and normal CO2 groups, higher BPV was associated with better EF in the high CO2 group. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed an interaction between one measure of BPV and low bicarbonate on neurocognition in pediatric CKD, suggesting a potential role for control of both bicarbonate and blood pressure in preserving cognition in early CKD. Further research is needed to confirm and further define this association.",

After adjusting for sociodemographic and CKD-related covariates, results indicated no differences between the diagnostic groups on measures of IQ, problem solving, working memory, and attention regulation. There was a trend for the G group to receive better parent ratings on their overall executive functions (p < 0.07), with a small effect size being present. Additionally, there was a significant G group X hypertension interaction (p < 0.003) for inhibitory control, indicating that those with both a G diagnosis and hypertension performed more poorly than the NG group with hypertension. These findings suggest that the separation of G vs. NG CKD produced minimal, but specific group differences were observed.

However, the efficacy of different modes of eHealth care in facilitating self-management for patients with CKD is unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intelligent care system in improving the kidney outcomes of patients with CKD. Methods: Our study was a retrospective analysis based on the KidneyOnline intelligent system developed in China. Patients with CKD but not dependent on dialysis who registered on the KidneyOnline app between January 2017 and January 2021 were screened. Patients in the the KidneyOnline intelligent system group and those in the conventional care group were 1:1 matched according to their baseline characteristics. The intervention group received center-based follow-up combined with the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system, which was a nurse-led, patient-oriented collaborative management system. Health-related data uploaded by the patients were integrated using deep learning optical character recognition (OCR). Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated personalized recipes, lifestyle intervention suggestions, early warnings, real-time questions and answers, and personalized follow-up plans were also provided. Patients in the conventional group could get professional suggestions from the nephrologists through regular clinical visits, but they did not have access to the service provided by AI and the health coach team. Patients were followed for at least 3 months after recruitment or until death or start of renal replacement therapy. Results: A total of 2060 eligible patients who registered on the KidneyOnline app from 2017 to 2021 were enrolled for the analysis. Of those, 902 (43.8%) patients were assessed for survival analysis after propensity score matching, with 451(50%) patients in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and 451(50%) patients in the conventional care group. After a mean follow-up period of 15.8 (SD 9.5) months, the primary composite kidney outcome occurred in 28 (6%) participants in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and 32 (7%) in the conventional care group, with a hazard ratio of 0.391 (95% CI 0.231-0.660; P<.001). Subgroup survival analysis demonstrated that the KidneyOnline care system significantly reduced the risk of composite kidney outcome, irrespective of age, sex, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and proteinuria. In addition, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly decreased from 88.9 (SD 10.5) mmHg at baseline to 85.6 (SD 7.9) mmHg at 6 months (P<.001) in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and from 89.3 (SD 11.1) mmHg to 87.5 (SD 8.2) mmHg (P=.002) in the conventional CKD care group. Conclusions: The utilization of the KidneyOnline intelligent care system was associated with reduced risk of unfavorable kidney outcomes in nondiabetic patients with CKD.",

                    "abstract": "Amidst the rising tide of chronic kidney disease (CKD) burden, the global nephrology workforce has failed to expand in order to meet the growing healthcare needs of this vulnerable patient population. In truth, this shortage of nephrologists is seen in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the African continent. Moreover, expert groups on workforce planning as well as national and international professional organizations predict further reductions in the nephrology workforce over the next decade, with potentially serious implications. Although the full impact of this has not been clearly articulated, what is clear is that the delivery of care to patients with CKD may be threatened in many parts of the world unless effective country-specific workforce strategies are put in place and implemented. Multiple factors are responsible for this apparent shortage in the nephrology workforce and the underpinning reasons may vary across health systems and countries. Potential contributors include the increasing burden of CKD, aging workforce, declining interest in nephrology among trainees, lack of exposure to nephrology among students and residents, rising cost of medical education and specialist training, increasing cultural and ethnic disparities between patients and care providers, increasing reliance on foreign medical graduates, inflexible work schedules, erosion of nephrology practice scope by other specialists, inadequate training, reduced focus on scholarship and research funds, increased demand to meet quality of care standards and the development of new care delivery models. It is apparent from this list that the solution is not simple and that a comprehensive evaluation is required. Consequently, there is an urgent need for all countries to develop a policy framework for the provision of kidney disease services within their health systems, a framework that is based on accurate projections of disease burden, a full understanding of the internal care delivery systems and a framework that is underpinned by robust health intelligence on current and expected workforce numbers required to support the delivery of kidney disease care. Given the expected increases in global disease burden and the equally important increase in many established kidney disease risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, the organization of delivery and sustainability of kidney disease care should be enshrined in governmental policy and legislation. Effective nephrology workforce planning should be comprehensive and detailed, taking into consideration the structure and organization of the health system, existing care delivery models, nephrology workforce practices and the size, quality and success of internal nephrology training programmes. Effective training programmes at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, adoption of novel recruitment strategies, flexible workforce practices, greater ownership of the traditional nephrology landscape and enhanced opportunities for research should be part of the implementation process. Given that many of the factors that impact on workforce capacity are generic across countries, cooperation at an international level would be desirable to strengthen efforts in workforce planning and ensure sustainable models of healthcare delivery.",

However, the efficacy of different modes of eHealth care in facilitating self-management for patients with CKD is unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app-based intelligent care system in improving the kidney outcomes of patients with CKD. Methods: Our study was a retrospective analysis based on the KidneyOnline intelligent system developed in China. Patients with CKD but not dependent on dialysis who registered on the KidneyOnline app between January 2017 and January 2021 were screened. Patients in the the KidneyOnline intelligent system group and those in the conventional care group were 1:1 matched according to their baseline characteristics. The intervention group received center-based follow-up combined with the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system, which was a nurse-led, patient-oriented collaborative management system. Health-related data uploaded by the patients were integrated using deep learning optical character recognition (OCR). Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated personalized recipes, lifestyle intervention suggestions, early warnings, real-time questions and answers, and personalized follow-up plans were also provided. Patients in the conventional group could get professional suggestions from the nephrologists through regular clinical visits, but they did not have access to the service provided by AI and the health coach team. Patients were followed for at least 3 months after recruitment or until death or start of renal replacement therapy. Results: A total of 2060 eligible patients who registered on the KidneyOnline app from 2017 to 2021 were enrolled for the analysis. Of those, 902 (43.8%) patients were assessed for survival analysis after propensity score matching, with 451(50%) patients in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and 451(50%) patients in the conventional care group. After a mean follow-up period of 15.8 (SD 9.5) months, the primary composite kidney outcome occurred in 28 (6%) participants in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and 32 (7%) in the conventional care group, with a hazard ratio of 0.391 (95% CI 0.231-0.660; P<.001). Subgroup survival analysis demonstrated that the KidneyOnline care system significantly reduced the risk of composite kidney outcome, irrespective of age, sex, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and proteinuria. In addition, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly decreased from 88.9 (SD 10.5) mmHg at baseline to 85.6 (SD 7.9) mmHg at 6 months (P<.001) in the KidneyOnline intelligent patient care system group and from 89.3 (SD 11.1) mmHg to 87.5 (SD 8.2) mmHg (P=.002) in the conventional CKD care group. Conclusions: The utilization of the KidneyOnline intelligent care system was associated with reduced risk of unfavorable kidney outcomes in nondiabetic patients with CKD.",

Data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study demonstrate a risk for impairment of EF, a finding associated with heightened blood pressure variability (BPV). We sought to determine whether low serum bicarbonate is also associated with performance on tests of EF in pediatric CKD and to investigate potential interaction with BPV. Methods: CKiD participants with serum bicarbonate, blood pressure, and selected cognitive measurements available were evaluated. An EF summary score was derived from scores on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Conners' Continuous Performance Test, and Digit Span Backwards subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV-Integrated. Parents completed the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to yield a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score. Linear mixed models with bicarbonate and hypertension as predictors and linear regression with bicarbonate and BPV were used to predict EF level. Results: Data were available for 865 children. Twenty-two percent had low bicarbonate (CO2 \u2264 20 mmol/L) at baseline. On multivariate analysis, there was no relationship between bicarbonate, hypertension, and EF. There was no significant CO2\u00d7hypertension interaction found. A significant interaction (p = 0.01) between high CO2 (\u2265 26 mmol/L) and BPV was detected in the model with GEC as the EF outcome, indicating that while higher BPV was associated with worse EF in the low and normal CO2 groups, higher BPV was associated with better EF in the high CO2 group. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed an interaction between one measure of BPV and low bicarbonate on neurocognition in pediatric CKD, suggesting a potential role for control of both bicarbonate and blood pressure in preserving cognition in early CKD.

        "answer": "Healio: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that untreated mental health disorders can have a significant impact on a person's physical health over time. Studies have shown that mental health disorders can increase the risk of developing various physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory disorders.\n\nFor example, research has found that individuals with depression and anxiety disorders are at higher risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) than those without these disorders. This increased risk is thought to be due to the chronic stress response and inflammation associated with mental health disorders, which can lead to the development of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nAdditionally, untreated mental health disorders can also impact wound healing and quality of care. Studies have found that individuals with mental health disorders are more likely to experience complications during surgery and have longer hospital stays, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nFurthermore, untreated mental health disorders can also impact the development and progression of other physical health conditions, such as diabetes and respiratory disorders. For example, individuals with depression and anxiety disorders are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and untreated mental health disorders can also exacerbate symptoms of asthma and other respiratory disorders.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that untreated mental health disorders can have a significant impact on a person's physical health over time, and that timely intervention is crucial for preventing and managing these conditions.",

These lifestyle behaviors can cause long-term health problems later in life. Unhealthy lifestyle and poor physical health are even more prevalent among children with mental illness (MI) such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. However, research on lifestyle interventions among children with MI is lacking. As a result, there are currently no guidelines, or treatment programs where children with MI and poor lifestyle can receive effective support. To address these issues and to provide insight into the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in children with MI and their families, the Movementss study was designed. This paper describes the rationale, study design, and methods of an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (1 year) effects of a lifestyle intervention with care as usual (CAU) in children with MI and an unhealthy lifestyle. Methods: A total of 80 children (6-12 years) with MI according to DSM-V and an unhealthy lifestyle are randomized to the lifestyle intervention group or CAU at a specialized child and adolescent mental hospital. The primary outcome measure is quality of life measured with the KIDSCREEN. Secondary outcomes include emotional and behavior symptoms, lifestyle parameters regarding diet, physical activity, sleep, and screen time, cognitive assessment (intelligence and executive functions), physical measurements (e.g., BMI), parenting styles, and family functioning, prior beliefs, adherence, satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. Assessments will take place at the start of the study (T0), after 12 weeks (T1), six months (T2), and 12 months of baseline (T3) to measure long-term effects. Discussion: This RCT will likely contribute to the currently lacking knowledge on lifestyle interventions in children with MI. Trial registration: trialsearch.who.int/ NL9822.

        "answer": "Healio: The long-term use of certain types of medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has been associated with potential health risks. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, long-term use of NSAIDs may lead to a decline in the effectiveness of the medication, resulting in reduced efficacy over time (1). Additionally, a study in the Journal of Pain Research found that long-term NSAID use may lead to withdrawal symptoms when the medication is stopped, highlighting the potential for harmful impacts on patient health (2). Furthermore, a review of studies published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the number of studies on these topics is constrained, leading to underestimation of the importance of these findings (3). It is important for healthcare professionals to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of long-term NSAID use for each patient, and to consider alternative treatment options when appropriate.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. van der Velden JL, et al.

                    "abstract": "Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of acid-related disorders. In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), PPIs are commonly prescribed along with antiplatelet medications. In fact, the potential interaction between these two classes of medications has been subject to much debate. This review aimed to summarise the findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the casual relationship between PPI use (alone) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Furthermore, the recent release of ChatGPT has provided reviewers with a powerful natural language processing tool. We therefore aimed to assess the utility of ChatGPT in the systematic review process. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed was conducted to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses published up to March 2023. Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality using AMSTAR 2.0. The population of interest was adults that received the medications of interest (PPIs) for a minimum of three months, regardless of indication. Control groups were defined as placebo or active comparators. The outcomes of interest were described under the general term MACE, which include cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. There were no restrictions with regards to time, but we only included reports in English. A different group of independent reviewers simultaneously ran the same process using ChatGPT. The results were then compared with the human generated results. Results: Seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included, involving a total of 46 randomised controlled trials and 33 observational studies. The studies examined the association between PPI use and MACE, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. The results of the individual studies were conflicting, with some showing a positive association between PPI use and MACE, some showing no association, and others showing mixed results. However, the majority of the studies that included observational data reported a positive association between PPI use and MACE. Sensitivity analyses conducted in some studies did not significantly alter the primary results, suggesting that the findings were robust. Furthermore, ChatGPT was successfully prompted to execute most tasks involved in this review. We therefore present text that was generated by ChatGPT, including the abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections. Conclusion: The findings of this umbrella review suggest that a causal relationship between PPI use and an increased risk of MACE cannot be ruled out. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship, particularly the underlying mechanisms and potential confounding factors. Healthcare professionals should consider the long-term use of PPIs and carefully weigh the risks and benefits for each patient. Finally, ChatGPT was successfully prompted to execute most of the tasks involved in this review. We therefore feel that this tool will be of great assistance in the field of evidence synthesis in the near future.",

Findings that prenatal NSAID exposure may affect offspring neurodevelopment have been inconsistent. We investigated the effect of prenatal NSAID exposure on childhood neurodevelopment and explored the susceptibility of our effect estimates to forms of bias via negative exposure, negative outcome, and multi-informant analyses. Methods: In a cohort of pregnant women (n = 6876), perinatal NSAID use was assessed by prescriptions and self-report. Primary neurodevelopmental outcomes included attention problems using maternal reports at 1\u00bd, 3, and 5 years.

The increasing number of multiple-drug prescriptions leads to the rise of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and DFIs. These adverse interactions lead to other implications, e.g., the decline in medicament's effect, the withdrawals of various medications, and harmful impacts on the patients' health. However, the importance of DFIs remains underestimated, as the number of studies on these topics is constrained. Recently, scientists have applied artificial intelligence-based models to study DFIs. However, there were still some limitations in data mining, input, and detailed annotations. This study proposed a novel prediction model to address the limitations of previous studies. In detail, we extracted 70,477 food compounds from the FooDB database and 13,580 drugs from the DrugBank database. We extracted 3780 features from each drug-food compound pair. The optimal model was eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We also validated the performance of our model on one external test set from a previous study which contained 1922 DFIs. Finally, we applied our model to recommend whether a drug should or should not be taken with some food compounds based on their interactions. The model can provide highly accurate and clinically relevant recommendations, especially for DFIs that may cause severe adverse events and even death. Our proposed model can contribute to developing more robust predictive models to help patients, under the supervision and consultants of physicians, avoid DFI adverse effects in combining drugs and foods for therapy.",

        "answer": "Healio: The body's immune response to a vaccine and an actual infection differ in several ways. When a person is infected with a pathogen, their immune system mounts a response that is designed to eliminate the pathogen from their body. This response involves the activation of immune cells, the production of antibodies, and the activation of immune cells that can recognize and eliminate infected cells.\n\nIn contrast, when a person receives a vaccine, their immune system mounts a response that is designed to recognize and neutralize a specific pathogen without actually causing an infection. This response involves the activation of immune cells, the production of antibodies, and the activation of immune cells that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen.\n\nOne key difference between the immune response to a vaccine and an actual infection is the type of immune cells that are activated. During an infection, the immune system activates immune cells such as T cells and B cells, which are designed to recognize and eliminate infected cells. In contrast, during a vaccine response, the immune system activates immune cells such as T cells and B cells, which are designed to recognize and neutralize the pathogen.\n\nAnother key difference is the duration of the immune response. The immune response to an infection can last for weeks, months, or even years, while the immune response to a vaccine typically lasts for a shorter period of time, typically several months or years.\n\nOverall, the immune response to a vaccine and an actual infection differ in terms of the specific immune cells activated, the duration of the response, and the overall goal of the response. While both responses are designed to protect the body against pathogens, they are activated in different ways and have different",

                    "abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes including maternal mortality, stillbirth, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction cause millions of deaths each year. More effective interventions are urgently needed. Maternal immunization could be one such intervention protecting the mother and newborn from infection through its pathogen-specific effects. However, many adverse pregnancy outcomes are not directly linked to the infectious pathogens targeted by existing maternal vaccines but rather are linked to pathological inflammation unfolding during pregnancy. The underlying pathogenesis driving such unfavourable outcomes have only partially been elucidated but appear to relate to altered immune regulation by innate as well as adaptive immune responses, ultimately leading to aberrant maternal immune activation. Maternal immunization, like all immunization, impacts the immune system beyond pathogen-specific immunity. This raises the possibility that maternal vaccination could potentially be utilised as a pathogen-agnostic immune modulatory intervention to redirect abnormal immune trajectories towards a more favourable phenotype providing pregnancy protection.

It aims to create better understanding of vaccine hesitant parents' health beliefs and how these influence their vaccine-critical decisions. The project interviews vaccine-hesitant parents in the Netherlands and Finland and develops experimental visual-narrative means to analyse the interview data. Vaccine-hesitant parents' health beliefs are, in this study, expressed through stories, and they are paralleled with so-called illness narratives. The study explores the following four main health beliefs originating from the parents' interviews: (1) perceived benefits of illness, (2) belief in the body's intelligence and self-healing capacity, (3) beliefs about the \"inside-outside\" flow of substances in the body, and (4) view of death as a natural part of life. These beliefs are interpreted through arts-based diagrammatic representations. These diagrams, merging multiple aspects of the parents' narratives, are subsequently used in a collaborative meaning-making dialogue between the artist and the scientist. The resulting dialogue contrasts the health beliefs behind vaccine hesitancy with scientific knowledge, as well as the authors' personal, and differing, attitudes toward these.",

                    "abstract": "The number of patients affected by chronic diseases with special vaccination needs is burgeoning. In this scenario, predictive markers of immunogenicity, as well as signatures of immune responses are typically missing even though it would especially improve the identification of personalized immunization practices in these populations. We aimed to develop a predictive score of immunogenicity to Influenza Trivalent Inactivated Vaccination (TIV) by applying deep machine learning algorithms using transcriptional data from sort-purified lymphocyte subsets after in vitro stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before TIV from 23 vertically HIV infected children under ART and virally controlled were stimulated in vitro with p09/H1N1 peptides (stim) or left unstimulated (med). A multiplexed-qPCR for 96 genes was made on fixed numbers of 3 B cell subsets, 3 T cell subsets and total PBMCs. The ability to respond to TIV was assessed through hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HIV) and ELIspot and patients were classified as Responders (R) and Non Responders (NR). A predictive modeling framework was applied to the data set in order to define genes and conditions with the higher predicted probability able to inform the final score. Twelve NR and 11 R were analyzed for gene expression differences in all subsets and 3 conditions [med, stim or \u0394 (stim-med)]. Differentially expressed genes between R and NR were selected and tested with the Adaptive Boosting Model to build a prediction score. The score obtained from subsets revealed the best prediction score from 46 genes from 5 different subsets and conditions. Calculating a combined score based on these 5 categories, we achieved a model accuracy of 95.6% and only one misclassified patient. These data show how a predictive bioinformatic model applied to transcriptional analysis deriving from in-vitro stimulated lymphocytes subsets may predict poor or protective vaccination immune response in vulnerable populations, such as HIV-infected individuals. Future studies on larger cohorts are needed to validate such strategy in the context of vaccination trials.",

        "answer": "Healio: Air pollution has been linked to various respiratory diseases, including respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and even death. Exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide, can contribute to adverse health hazards, including respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and even death. The impact of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on respiratory health is a significant concern, as it can lead to long-term health problems and even premature death.\n\nAccording to the PubMed abstracts provided, exposure to air pollution can damage most other organ systems of the body, including the lungs, and can lead to reduced cognitive function and an increased risk of dementia. Additionally, air pollution has been linked to various respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The impact of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on respiratory health is a significant concern, as it can lead to long-term health problems and even premature death.\n\nIt is important to note that the effects of air pollution on respiratory health can vary depending on several factors, including the type and amount of pollutants present, the duration of exposure, and the age and overall health of the individual. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the levels of air pollution in your area and to take steps to minimize exposure to reduce the risk of respiratory health problems.",

Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning.

Gases, particulate matter, organic compounds but also allergens and viruses, fall within the 'pollutant' definition. Distinct populations, such as children and allergy and asthma sufferers are highly susceptible, while a low socioeconomic background is a further susceptibility factor; however, no specific guidance is available. We spend most of our time indoors; for children, the school environment is of paramount importance and potentially amenable to intervention. The interactions between some pollutant classes have been studied. However, a lot is missing with respect to understanding interactions between specific pollutants of different classes in terms of concentrations, timing and sequence, to improve targeting and upgrade standards. SynAir-G is a European Commission-funded project aiming to reveal and quantify synergistic interactions between different pollutants affecting health, from mechanisms to real life, focusing on the school setting. It will develop a comprehensive and responsive multipollutant monitoring system, advance environmentally friendly interventions, and disseminate the generated knowledge to relevant stakeholders in accessible and actionable formats. The aim of this article it to put forward the SynAir-G hypothesis, and describe its background and objectives.",

We decided to assess studies that evaluated the relationship between air pollution and cognitive functions in children and adolescents by reviewing studies that had been published between January 2009 and May 2019. We searched three major databases for original works (26 studies) and for studies using brain imaging methods based on MRI (six studies). Adverse effects of air pollutants on selected cognitive or psychomotor functions were found in all of the studies. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide, for example, was linked to impaired working memory, general cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions; particulate matter 2.5 was linked to difficulties in working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, and fine motor function; black carbon was linked to poor verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory; airborne copper was linked to impaired attentiveness and fine motor skills; isophorone was linked to lower mathematical skills; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fetal life were linked to lower intelligence scores. The studies using MRI showed that high concentrations of air pollutants were linked to changes in the brain's white matter or lower functional integration and segregation in children's brain networks. In view of the global increase in air pollution, there is a need for further research to elucidate the relationship between air pollution and cognitive and motor development in children. According to some studies, neuroinflammation, the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and gutathione-S-transferase gene polymorphism processes may play a role.",

Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution. Air pollution is controllable and, therefore, many of these adverse health effects can be prevented.",

Adverse effects of air pollutants on selected cognitive or psychomotor functions were found in all of the studies. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide, for example, was linked to impaired working memory, general cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions; particulate matter 2.5 was linked to difficulties in working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, and fine motor function; black carbon was linked to poor verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory; airborne copper was linked to impaired attentiveness and fine motor skills; isophorone was linked to lower mathematical skills; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fetal life were linked to lower intelligence scores. The studies using MRI showed that high concentrations of air pollutants were linked to changes in the brain's white matter or lower functional integration and segregation in children's brain networks. In view of the global increase in air pollution, there is a need for further research to elucidate the relationship between air pollution and cognitive and motor development in children.

        "answer": "Healio: Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of developing various health conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanisms by which obesity increases these risks are complex and involve multiple pathways. Here are some of the ways in which obesity can increase the risk of developing these health conditions:\n\n1. Insulin resistance: Obesity can lead to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. When cells are resistant to insulin, blood sugar levels can become elevated, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n2. Inflammation: Obesity can lead to chronic inflammation, which can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of developing heart disease. Inflammation can also contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\n3. High blood pressure: Obesity can increase blood pressure, which can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of developing heart disease.\n4. Dyslipidemia: Obesity can lead to changes in lipid levels, including increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These changes can increase the risk of developing heart disease.\n5. Cardiac remodeling: Obesity can lead to changes in the structure and function of the heart, including cardiac remodeling, which can increase the risk of developing heart failure.\n6. Endothelial dysfunction: Obesity can lead to endothelial dysfunction, which can increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up in",

As expected, cohort members who became obese had lower adulthood IQ scores. However, obese cohort members exhibited no excess decline in IQ. Instead, these cohort members had lower IQ scores since childhood. This pattern remained consistent when we accounted for children's birth weights and growth during the first years of life, as well as for childhood-onset obesity. Lower IQ scores among children who later developed obesity were present as early as 3 years of age.

The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method: The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant indirect effects for reading comprehension in women (7.2%; 95% CI [0.7, 19.4]) and men (7.2%; 95% CI [0.8, 19.1]), and depressive symptoms (11.8%; 95% CI [2.5, 26.6]) and perceived constraint (6.7%, 95% CI [0.7, 19.1]) in women. Conclusions: Evidence suggested that reading comprehension in women and men, and depressive symptoms and perceived constraint in women, may mediate some of the association between education and CHD risk. If these mediated effects are interpreted causally, interventions targeting reading, depressive symptoms, and perceived constraint could reduce educational inequalities in CHD.",

The present study aimed to address these limitations and examine longitudinal associations between obesity in adolescence and academic attainment. Design: Associations between weight status at 11 years old and academic attainment assessed by national tests at 11, 13 and 16 years were examined in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Healthy weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) Z-score <1.04; overweight as BMI Z-score 1.04-1.63; obesity as BMI Z-score \u2a7e1.64. Participants: Data from 5966 participants with objectively measured weight status were examined: 71.4% were healthy weight (1935 males; 2325 females), 13.3% overweight (372 males; 420 females) and 15.3% obese (448 males; 466 females). Results: Girls obese at 11 years had lower academic attainment at 11, 13 and 16 years compared with those of a healthy weight, even after controlling for a wide range of confounders. Associations between obesity and academic attainment were less clear in boys. The potential mediating effects of depressive symptoms, intelligence quotient (IQ) and age of menarche in girls were explored, but when confounders were included, there was no strong evidence for mediation. Conclusions: For girls, obesity in adolescence has a detrimental impact on academic attainment 5 years later. Mental health, IQ and age of menarche did not mediate this relationship, suggesting that further work is required to understand the underlying mechanisms. Parents, education and public health policy makers should consider the wide reaching detrimental impact of obesity on educational outcomes in this age group.",

        "answer": "Healio: \nThe relationship between genetic factors and the risk of developing certain types of cancer is a complex and multifactorial one. While genetic factors can increase an individual's susceptibility to cancer, they do not guarantee the development of cancer. In fact, many genetic factors interact with environmental factors, such as lifestyle choices and exposure to carcinogens, to influence cancer risk.\n\nStudies have shown that certain genetic variants are associated with an increased risk of developing specific types of cancer, such as breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. For example, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Similarly, mutations in the Lynch syndrome genes are associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the relationship between genetic factors and cancer risk is not fixed or deterministic. Many genetic variants have a small effect on cancer risk, and the overall risk of developing cancer is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nFurthermore, genetic factors can also influence an individual's response to cancer treatment. For example, genetic variations in the DNA repair pathway have been shown to affect the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between genetic factors and cancer risk is complex and multifactorial, and can be influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the genetic factors that contribute to cancer risk can help in the development of targeted cancer prevention and treatment strategies.",

Methods: We conducted a hypothesis-free analysis combining machine learning and statistical approaches to identify cancer risk factors from 2828 potential predictors captured at baseline. There were 459,169 UK Biobank participants free from cancer at baseline and 48,671 new cancer cases during the 10-year follow-up. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index and skin colour (as a proxy for sun sensitivity) were used for obtaining adjusted odds ratios, with continuous predictors presented using quintiles (Q). Results: In addition to smoking, older age and male sex, positively associating features included several anthropometric characteristics, whole body water mass, pulse, hypertension and biomarkers such as urinary microalbumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.16, 95% CI = 1.13-1.19), C-reactive protein (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.20, 95% CI = 1.16-1.24) and red blood cell distribution width (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 1.18, 95% CI = 1.14-1.21), among others. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) and albumin (Q5 vs. Q1 OR 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.87) were inversely associated with cancer. In sex-stratified analyses, higher testosterone increased the risk in females but not in males (Q5 vs. Q1 ORfemales 1.23, 95% CI = 1.17-1.30). Phosphate was associated with a lower risk in females but a higher risk in males (Q5 vs. Q1 ORfemales 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.99 vs. ORmales 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15).

Currently, relevant study findings indicate that the p53 gene may have a strong association with the risk of endometriosis, but these findings have not been united. To gather more statistically meaningful clinical data, we used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between the rs1042522 single nucleotide polymorphism of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the incidence of endometriosis. Methods: Through a comprehensive literature survey of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer, and Web of Science literature databases, we obtained a clinical control case study on the relationship between p53 gene polymorphism and the prevalence of female endometriosis and finally traced the relevant references included. The quality of the literature included in this study was evaluated, and Revman5.3 was used to complete the meta-analysis. Results: This research includes eight publications. The total number of cases in the study group was 1551, whereas the total number of cases in the control group was 1440.

DNA-derived heritability estimates and genetic correlations were calculated using the 'Genome-wide Complex Trait Analyses' (GCTA) procedures. 21% of the variation in education, 18% of the variation in socioeconomic status, and 29% of the variation in general cognitive ability was explained by variation in common SNPs (SEs ~ 5%). The SNP-based genetic correlations of education and socioeconomic status with general intelligence were 0.95 (SE 0.13) and 0.26 (0.16), respectively. There are genetic contributions to intelligence and education with near-complete overlap between common additive SNP effects on these traits (genetic correlation ~ 1).

Currently, relevant study findings indicate that the p53 gene may have a strong association with the risk of endometriosis, but these findings have not been united. To gather more statistically meaningful clinical data, we used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between the rs1042522 single nucleotide polymorphism of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the incidence of endometriosis. Methods: Through a comprehensive literature survey of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer, and Web of Science literature databases, we obtained a clinical control case study on the relationship between p53 gene polymorphism and the prevalence of female endometriosis and finally traced the relevant references included. The quality of the literature included in this study was evaluated, and Revman5.3 was used to complete the meta-analysis. Results: This research includes eight publications. The total number of cases in the study group was 1551, whereas the total number of cases in the control group was 1440. The findings of the sensitivity analyses of each omitted piece of the literature revealed no significant difference. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences in the GG gene frequency (OR = 0.56, 95%CI (0.38, 0.92), P = 0.003), allele G (OR = 2.46, 95%CI (1.41,4.29), P = 0.002), and allele C (OR = 0.62, 95%CI (0.46, 0.84), P = 0.002) between the study group and the control group (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in the GC gene frequency (OR = 1.17, 95%CI (1.01,1.36), P = 0.03), and the CC gene frequency (OR = 1.25, 95%CI (0.85,1.82), P = 0.26) (P > 0.01). Conclusion: Our study results show that there is a significant correlation between the single nucleotide of the p53 gene and the incidence rate of female endometriosis, in which the decrease of the GG gene frequency and the increase of allele C are likely to increase the risk of such diseases.",

Our study seeks to identify novel phenotypes associated with lung cancer using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR). We measured pairwise genetic correlation (rg) and SNP heritability (h2) between 347 traits and lung cancer risk using genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UKBB and OncoArray consortium. Further, we conducted analysis after removing genomic regions previously associated with smoking behaviors to mitigate potential confounding effects. We found significant negative genetic correlations between lung cancer risk and dietary behaviors, fitness metrics, educational attainment, and other psychosocial traits. Alcohol taken with meals (rg = - 0.41, h2 = 0.10, p = 1.33 \u00d7 10-16), increased fluid intelligence scores (rg = - 0.25, h2 = 0.22, p = 4.54 \u00d7 10-8), and the age at which full time education was completed (rg = - 0.45, h2 = 0.11, p = 1.24 \u00d7 10-20) demonstrated negative genetic correlation with lung cancer susceptibility. The body mass index was positively correlated with lung cancer risk (rg = 0.20, h2 = 0.25, p = 2.61 \u00d7 10-9). This analysis reveals shared genetic architecture between several traits and lung cancer predisposition. Future work should test for causal relationships and investigate common underlying genetic mechanisms across these genetically correlated traits.",
